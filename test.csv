I'll be back in a couple of days with the answers. \- Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away? \- Any fool can get into college. Only a select few can say the same about Amanda Jones. \- My dear, since Eve picked the apple, no woman has ever been taken entirely unawares. \- This is Tommy. He tells people he's named after a gun, but I know he's named after a famous 19th century ballerina. \- When one woman strikes at the heart of another she seldom misses, and the wound is invariably fatal. \- I've never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. With my dress off, it's _most_ unusual. \- You're nothing to me now. You're not a brother, you're not a friend. I don't want to know you or what you do. I don't want to see you at the hotels, I don't want you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there. \- Kids: 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery. \- Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone. \- A hundred million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet smaller than my sister. \- Mother, I do not need a blind date. Particularly not with some verbally incontinent spinster who drinks like a fish, smokes like a chimney and dresses like her mother. \- Have you ever seen a body like this before in your life? She happens to be my daughter. Oh. Then I guess you have. \- I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is. \- Of course, you won't be able to lie on your back for a while but then you can lie from any position, can't you? \- The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen. \- Women need a reason for having sex. Men just need a place. \- You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else. \- Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue! \- The issue is not whether you are paranoid. Look around you Lenny. The issue is whether you are paranoid enough. \- Inconceivable! You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. Enjoy.  "

"Subject: Experts Scale Back Estimates of World Population Growth The demographic transition, where birthrates are lowered by increased life expectancy, seems to be happening faster than the experts have anticipated. I attribute this apparently precipitous decline in 'sustainable' development to the twin evils of increasing personal freedom and economic globalization. Somebody oughta pass a law to prevent those things, of course, before it's too late. The People's way of life *must* be preserved in its natural, pre- industrial state, or we'll lose it forever. ;-). Cheers, RAH http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/20/science/earth/20POPU.html?pagewanted=print&position;=top The New York Times August 20, 2002 Experts Scale Back Estimates of World Population Growth By BARBARA CROSSETTE Demography has never been an exact science. Ever since social thinkers began trying to predict the pace of population growth a century or two ago, the people being counted have been surprising the experts and confounding projections. Today, it is happening again as stunned demographers watch birthrates plunge in ways they never expected. Only a few years ago, some experts argued that economic development and education for women were necessary precursors for declines in population growth. Today, village women and slum families in some of the poorest countries are beginning to prove them wrong, as fertility rates drop faster than predicted toward the replacement level - 2.1 children for the average mother, one baby to replace each parent, plus a fraction to compensate for unexpected deaths in the overall population. A few decades ago in certain countries like Brazil, Egypt, India and Mexico fertility rates were as high as five or six. As a result, United Nations demographers who once predicted the earth's population would peak at 12 billion over the next century or two are scaling back their estimates. Instead, they cautiously predict, the world's population will peak at 10 billion before 2200, when it may begin declining. Some experts are wary of too much optimism, however. At the Population Council, an independent research organization in New York, Dr. John Bongaarts has studied population declines in various countries over the last half century. He questions the assumption that when fertility declines begin they will continue to go down at the same pace, especially if good family planning services are not widely available. Sharp fertility declines in many industrialized and middle-income countries had already challenged another old belief: that culture and religion would thwart efforts to cut fertility. In Italy, a Roman Catholic country whose big families were the stuff of cinema, family size is shrinking faster than anywhere else in Europe, and the population is aging rapidly as fewer children are born. Islamic Iran has also had great success with family planning. 'Projections aren't terribly accurate over the long haul,' said Dr. Nicholas Eberstadt, a demography expert at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. 'Demographers have been surprised by just about every big fertility change in the modern period. Demographers didn't anticipate the baby boom. They did not anticipate the subsequent decline in fertility in industrialized Western democracies.' What's next? Demographers can agree generally on a few measurable facts and some trends. The world's population, now 6.2 billion, quadrupled in the 20th century, and changed in drastic ways. In 1900, 86 percent of the world's people lived in rural areas and about 14 percent in urban areas. By 2000, urban communities were home to 47 percent of the population, with 53 percent still in the countryside. Between now and 2030, when the global population is expected to reach about eight billion, almost all the growth will be in cities. But urbanization is not necessarily a bad thing for the environment, said Dr. Joseph Chamie, director of the United Nations' population division. 'Moving to cities frees up the land for forestry, agriculture and many other activities,' Dr. Chamie said. 'You're getting people concentrated, so you can probably recycle more easily. People change their lifestyles. The Indian moving from the boonies of Uttar Pradesh to the city of Lucknow gets educational opportunities, cultural opportunities, all sorts of political participation. He can be influenced by advertising and public relations campaigns. Immunization will be better, and family planning.' As births fall and lives are extended, the global population is getting older. The over-80 age group is the fastest growing. But not everywhere. For example, the United Nations calculates that life expectancy at birth is being slashed in countries hardest hit by AIDS. In South Africa, the life of a baby born now should be 66 years; AIDS has cut that to 47. In Zimbabwe, the drop has been to 43 years from 69. In Botswana, it is 36 years, down from 70. Another cautionary sign from projections is that where populations are continuing to grow fastest, societies and governments may be least likely to cope with the results, including strains on natural resources - farmland, water, air, forests and animals. Last year, the organization published a report and wall chart, 'Population, Environment and Development,' plotting and analyzing population changes as its contribution to the debate surrounding the Johannesburg summit meeting. The United Nations estimates that the world's current population, 6.2 billion, is growing at an annual rate slightly over 1.2 percent, producing some 77 million people. Of this growth, 97 percent is taking place in less- developed countries, said Dr. Chamie, whose position at the United Nations makes him chief keeper of the world's statistics. Six nations will dominate this growth, and in this order: India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Thus, though fertility is declining unexpectedly in a poor country like India, which has more than a billion people, the actual numbers continue to rise rapidly because the base is so large. India is gaining as many people annually as China, Pakistan and Nigeria combined, the United Nations says. India is projected to have at least 100 million more people than China by 2050, even if China's one-child policy is relaxed. Small families are now the norm for the Chinese, whose standard of living has risen above that of the people of India by many measures. Among industrialized countries, the United States alone has a growth rate comparable to that of developing nations. It now ranks seventh in growth, Dr. Chamie said, but 80 percent of that growth comes from immigration. In Europe, populations are shrinking, even with more immigration. With much of the population bulge predicted in Asia, the East-West Center in Honolulu has just published a report, 'The Future of Population in Asia,' which finds cause to fear considerable environmental stress in a region where population densities and numbers are often great. Asia, the report notes, already has 56 percent of the world's population living on 31 percent of its arable land, and more than 900 million people exist on less than $1 a day. 'Asia faces the most acute pressure on arable agricultural land of any region in the world,' the report says, adding that expansion of farmland has been made at the cost of forests. Acute water scarcity, a significant loss of biodiversity and more urban pollution seem inevitable. Twelve of the world's 15 most polluted cities are in Asia. By 2020, the report predicts, Asia will be producing more carbon dioxide emissions than any other region. 'When looking at current and future environmental concerns in Asia,' the report concludes, 'the number of people to be fed, clothed, housed, transported, educated and employed may not be the only issue, but it is an issue that cannot be ignored.' \-- \----------------- R.

We have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,            plays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in            making money from home.  If they are, the system records their            name and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.                   - The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then            PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices and the following             info. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):                   Name:            Email:            Phone:            Best time to call:            State:            Reason they want to work from home!:            How much they want to make per month:            How much time they can commit per week:            How much money they have available for startup:            If they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:                   We'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no            more than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.                   - Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you,             from which the results are then forwarded to you by email.                   - This way, you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time*             (only minutes old).  Never more than 24 hours old.  Guaranteed!                   - We GUARANTEE that you'll receive AT LEAST a valid Name,             Phone Number and the Time-Date Stamp corresponding to when            the Lead was generated!  However, almost ALL leads will have            ALL of the information asked above.                               Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:                   1. They will be Extremely Qualified due to the nature of the             qualifying questions that will be asked (above).                   2. They are Super-Fresh!  Delivered in Real-Time only moments             after they are contacted and qualified!  (Not 30-120 days old)                   3. They're Targeted.  Each Lead we generate originates from a            targeted list of business opportunity seekers.                   4. They're Highly Receptive!  Receptivity is very, very high             because they aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching             them on opportunities!  Also they'll remember speaking to             someone over the phone.  Especially since we tell them to             expect your call!                   5. No 'feast or famine' activity.  Leads will be coming in             regularly.  You dictate the flow!                   6. No more cold calls!  We tell your prospects you'll be calling.                   7. You can *personalize* your approach with the info. you             get with each Lead!                   8. Save Time.  Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.                   9. Lower 'burnout' factor.  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier             to pick up the phone, day in and day out.                   10. You can sort your Leads based on their responses and call the            hottest ones first.                   11. You can get new reps started quicker using these Leads due             to higher closing ratios.  Of course, this builds faster and stronger             momentum, and skyrockets 'new rep retention' as a result of             'quick successes'.                   12. The Leads will be uniform - almost all leads will have the info.             indicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)                   13. They're double-qualified because to generate the Lead,             a list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.                   14. Excellent control of the flow of Leads coming through.                   If you've been trying to run things too long without a steady flow of high            quality leads, call us NOW to get things in motion.  Just let us know             what program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized             lead-generation campaign for you.

' fact : billions in oil revenue for geecf with only 35 million shares outstanding could easily translate into 5 or 10 dollars net per share earnings , designating geecf as a hot , mid - tier oil player with nyse qualifications . if this were the whole story , it would be more than ample reason to rate geecf as our hottest pick of the year . however , in addition , there is a geecf subsidiary dealing in the waste - to - energy sector that has secured a 10 billion , 5 - year contract with chinese government - run companies , including yanzhou coal mining ( nyse : yzc , 64 ) to supply their technology throughout china . there are no other companies on the otc that can match - up with geecf and their multi - billions in deals on the table . geecf shares will continue to soar and reward aggressive investors . geecf is on target for record - breaking revenues while turning savvy market players into millionaires as the value of their oil projects are revealed . disclosure : the information and opinions in this featured profile are based on sources believed to be reliable but no representation is made to its accuracy or completeness . past performance is not an indicator of future results . this report is a paid profile for information purposes only and should not be used as the basis for any investment decision . this newsletter has been compensated ten thousand dollars for the preparation of this profile and for continuing coverage of the featured company . newsletter publishers are not investment experts and this profile is not to be considered investment advice . this information is neither a solicitation to buy nor an offer to sell securities . information herein contains future - looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties . there are no shares presently held and no participation will occur in the trading of shares in any profiled company ."

"Subject: business intent dear sir , i am stanley woodwork , the secetary of africa white farmers co - operation ( awfc ) of zimbabwe . after the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president mr . robert mugabe won the presidential election , the government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme . this programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white african farmers for redistribution to black africans . this programme has attracted worldwide condemnation from world leaders including british prime minister , mr tony blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of victimization and physical abuse . two weeks ago , our headquartes in harare was attacked and looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building . fortunately , they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which belong to the co - operation . this cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government . now i have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe . the cash in question is us $ 46 million dollars . once i can get your commitment and sincerity of investing this funds on our behalf then i would proceed to get the funds freighted to europe , where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us . you do not have anything to worry about as i would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe , and the business proposal is 100 % legal and risk free . you would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe . please get back to me if you can be of assistance and i would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government . i expect 100 % confidentiality and your prompt response to this mail so as to proceed . you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork @ email . com kind regards , stanley woodwork ."

"Subject: The last time you spent $25 did you make $100,000,s?  Nows your Chance! Hello You may have seen this business before and ignored it. I know I did - many times! However, please take a few moments to read this letter. I was amazed when the profit potential of this business finally sunk in... and it works! With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail, success in this business is now fast, easy and well within the capabilities of ordinary people who know little about internet marketing. And the earnings potential is truly staggering! I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! - follow what it says to the letter - and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is President, or whether you keep your current job or not. Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. One day though, something just said: 'You throw away $25.00 going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.' Believe me, no matter where you believe those 'feelings' come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it. It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying and selling something of value. AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home. THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! ================================================== BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say 'Bull', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are 'absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost'. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: 'Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.' Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: 'This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.' More testimonials later but first, ======= ==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ==== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. ===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00. Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it will not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time. 1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success. ================================================== **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 each. Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 \+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 \+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ================================================== REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ================================================== Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report. ===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the 'cash' is not because this is illegal or somehow 'wrong'. It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you. ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! =============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== 'My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.' Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ================================================ 'Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.' Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ================================================= 'I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else......... 11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.' Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ================================================= 'It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20, in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.'

He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a semi-circle of darker sky. I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.

"Subject: 9/11, war in Iraq threaten Disney parks URL: http://boingboing.net/#85531557 Date: Not supplied Disney's themepark business is in deep trouble in the post-9/11 world. A war with Iraq could really kill 'em: While aggressively adding attractions, Disney boosted its profit by steadily raising admission prices. The strategy worked, helping deliver record profit for Disney year after year. 'The strategy was build, build, build. Every year there was something new,' said David Koenig, a Disney historian and author. 'It was an astounding growth period.... Now they're overexposed.'... Theme park operating income for Disney this year is expected to fall 27% to $1.16 billion, said Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias. By 2003, she said, the business could climb to $1.49 billion, depending on whether the U.S. goes to war with Iraq.

"Subject: Perens Backs Out of Stunt http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/ejournal/3735855.htm      Posted on Thu, Jul. 25, 2002          Copyright Law Thwarts Open Source Confab Demo     Posted by Dan Gillmor               Bruce Perens was going to demonstrate a modified DVD player at this week's     Open Source gathering in San Diego. He'd planned to show (Infoworld) how a     DVD player with its regional coding disabled could play DVDs with     different regional codes.          Perens was going to do this in violation, he believed, of the Digital     Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the circumvention of technological     methods to protect copyrighted material from uses the owner doesn't want.     And the possibility of legal trouble led his employer, Hewlett-Packard, to     ask him not to do the demonstration.          HP funds Perens to pursue a variety of free software projects. He was     willing to take the legal risks himself, he told me today, but HP worried     that it would be 'a more juicy target,' the kind of deep pockets that     might make the entertainment cartel drool. In that context it's     understandable why HP would be concerned, though I wish the company would     take a stand on the right side of this issue.          So while Perens is going to talk about the DMCA's pernicious impact on     things like free software, he's not going to give his demonstration. A     shame, but that's how things are going these days.          Hollywood is winning, folks. You are losing. And you'd better start caring                    http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork                 "

"Subject: FYI: WSE 2002 FYI, members of this list might be interested in the 4th International      Workshop on Web Site Evolution (WSE 2002), being held October 2, 2002, in     Montreal, Canada.          http://star.itc.it/wse2002/          - Jim          >>From the Web page:           The potential of the Web as a vehicle for offering a variety of services is     becoming more apparent as Web sites evolve their contents from static     information to more dynamic and interactive forms. A number of new standards     and commercial products are emerging, offering a basis for developing     Web-based services from dynamic composible resources, extending both the     range and scope of services that can be made available through the Web.          The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together members of the Web     design, software engineering, and information technology communities to     discuss techniques for migrating to Web services. Architectural styles and     tool support for service-based Web sites are currently quite diverse.     Expertise in constructing service-based Web pages is quite limited, and     experience accounts are lacking. The explosion of non-traditional computing     platforms for browsing the Web, such as PDAs, WAP-enabled phones, and     Internet appliances, is forcing Web professionals to rethink the separation     of form from content and the range and scope of services offered via the     Web.          WSE 2002 will provide an opportunity for the exchange of information related     to exciting new research and empirical results in areas including (but not     limited to):          *   Migrating to Web services     *   Web quality determination and improvement through process and product     control     *   Enhancing Web sites to make them more accessible, reliable, and usable     *   Analyzing and reverse-engineering Web site content and structure     *   Making Web site content available in multiple formats for multiple     platforms     *   Applying traditional software engineering activities such as     architecture, metrics, and testing to Web sites     *   Case studies of large-scale Web site reuse, reengineering, and evolution          WSE 2002 is co-located with the IEEE International Conference on Software     Maintenance (ICSM 2002). ICSM is the IEEE Computer Society's flagship event     focused on the modernization of existing systems. ICSM 2002's theme of     'maintaining distributed heterogeneous systems' nicely compliments WSE     2002's overall theme and goals.                    http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork                 "

"Subject: [zzzzteana] Betamax finally laid to rest Not fortean, but a moment in time all the same...           http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm               Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after     losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS.      Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000     more machines for the Japanese market.           They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998.                 VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s           Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better     quality than its VHS rival.           Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,     1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the     film rental industry and in homes.           Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002.           'With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the     market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to     secure parts,' Sony said in a statement.           Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the     format.           The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the     television and film industries and will be unaffected.           But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin     for Betamax home players.           In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format.           Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of     competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988.           The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,     although VHS tapes had a longer duration.           A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no     new ones will be made after the end of 2002.           Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.        See also:                               ------------------------ Yahoo!

"Subject: Family Targetted Advertising Forwarded-by: Rob Windsor  Forwarded-by: 'Dave Bruce'  Forwarded by: Gary Williams  A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding. The card said nothing but 'Maxwell House'. Mom was puzzled at first, but then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: 'Good till the last drop.' Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, and the card read: 'Benson & Hedges'. Mom now knew to go straight to her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 'Extra Long, King Size'. She was again slightly embarrassed but still happy for her daughter. The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean. Mom waited for a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing. Then after a whole month, a card finally arrived. Written on it with shaky handwriting were the words: 'British Airways'. Mom took out her latest Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, and finally found the ad for the airline. The ad said: 'Three times a day, seven days a week, both ways.' Mom fainted.  "

' ' more testimonials later but first : * * * * * print this now for your future reference & follow these simple instructions to make your financial dreams true ! * * * * * instructions : = = = = = = = = = = = = * * * * order all 5 reports shown on the list below . * * * * for each report , send $ 5 u . s . cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems . * * * * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the 5 reports * * * * you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . your up - front cost is only $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 . * * * * * * * * * within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who may order from you . also make a floppy of these reports and keep it at your desk in case something happens to your computer . * * * * * * * * * * important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will loose out on majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter , it will not work ! people have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money . but it does not work this way . believe us , we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed . because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! ! 1 . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their money . 2 . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 . 3 . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 . 4 . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 . 5 . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2 . 6 . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information that includes : how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail legally = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % . also , many people may send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each ) . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) emails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( a half million ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . . . . . . grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you can still make money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 people you mailed . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or 1 / 2 , or even one 1 / 5 of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 500 million people on the internet worldwide and counting . believe me , many people may do just that , and more ! method # 2 : placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet can easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the emails they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . order each report by its number & name only . note : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks or money orders are not accepted . make sure the cash is wrapped in at least 2 sheets of paper before you put it in the envelope . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number and the name of the report you are ordering , your email address , your name and postal address . make sure you affix proper ' international ' postage if ordering a report from outside your country . place your order for these reports now : report 1 : the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net . . . order from : p . hynes 6461 mayfield rd brampton , on canada l 6 t 3 z 8 report 2 : the insiders guide to sending bulk e - mail on the net . . . order from : lynn asbill 9400 bluebonnet dr scurry , tx 75158 usa report 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net . . . order from : greg grant po box 385 wilberforce , on canada kol 3 co report 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net . . . order from : lw 50 burnhamthorpe rd w suite 401 mississauga , on canada l 5 b 3 c 2 report 5 : how to send out one million emails & jump start your business . . . order from : bdm consulting po box 890 orem , ut 84059 usa there are currently almost 500 , 000 , 000 people online worldwide ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . . . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity . . . . it is up to you now !

"Subject: [SAtalk] Personal/Site-Wide SA Glitch (Spamassassin+Exim) Hello People, I am new to SA but (2) problems I do have. I run SA from my own home for personal use and it seems to work but I see this in my procmail log: procmail: Executing ' ~/bin/SpamAssassin/spamassassin -P -c ~/bin/SpamAssassin/rules' dccproc: not found dccproc: not found  Can someone enlighten me on why I get that? FreeBSD 4.6-STABLE, SA-2.3.0 Secondly, I've tested (now on Three boxes) SA for site-wide usage but I believe I am missing something major because I've also had my setting checked/verified. The problem is that the site-wide setup does NOT seem to work. Why? 1\. I have my local.cf in /etc/mail/spamassassin 2\.

"Subject: Re: [SAdev] results of scorer evaluation Daniel Quinlan wrote: DQ> Before we release, it'd be great if someone could test a few DQ> additional score ranges. Maybe we can lower FPs a bit more. :-) I don't think there's much more room for lowering FPs left which the GA can achieve. Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't factored in to the GA scores. The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as time goes on. The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 2.41 or 2.50 branches. DQ> Something like: DQ> DQ> for (low = -12; low <= -4; low += 2) DQ> for (high = 2; high <= 6; high += 2) DQ> evolve You could just allow low and high to be evolved by the GA (within ranges); I'd be enormously surprised if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, since that'd give the GA the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores. The issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous and liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and liable to be forged to generate FNs. DQ> Maybe even add a nybias loop. Adding an nybias loop is not worthwhile -- changing nybias scores will just alter the evaluation function's idea of what the FP:FN ratio should be.

"Subject: Online contents of Electronic Publishing journal I recently stumbled across the contents of the journal, 'Electronic Publishing', which was published from January, 1988 through December, 1995. All papers are available online in PDF (this was apparently one of the first journals to disseminate in PDF, in 1994). The journal also reprints some of the better papers from the Electronic Publishing conferences, held bi-yearly from 1986-1992 (EP86, EP88, EP90, EP92). http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/epoddtoc.html Today's reader might look at the contents and wonder about their relevance, since they don't directly discuss the Web. As an academic, I find this journal valuable, since the papers are of generally high quality (by top researchers), and they provide lots of pointers to the evolution of the ideas that led to many Web technologies. It's one source among many for sifting through the intellectual lineage of electronic publishing technologies. Rohit and Adam might find the following papers especially relevant, in the context of their WWW7 'Evolution of Document Species' paper: Page Description Languages: Development, Implementation and Standardization: A.

"Subject: When an engineer flaps his wings URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/03.html#when_an_engineer_flaps_his_wings Date: 2002-10-03T01:31:51-05:00 Remember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its wings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used to be the #1 'mark'[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and Google bombing[3]. Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for 'go to hell' [4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for 'talentless hack'[6] no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive with complaints and speculation: \- New update, pagerank death?[8] \- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] \- Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] (Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely false. Searching diveintomark.org for 'gimli'[11] finds my entry of July 29[12] , where 'Gimli' is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It didn't take long. \- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). \- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. \- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself (I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't that helpful. Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com [21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their results for 'eminem'[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the beginning of the end of Google's reign?

"Subject: Re[3]: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...) In addition, one bit of anecdotal evidence from a conversation in 1984! in San Fransisco is hardly enough to extrapolate 500 to 3k. This is the only quote I could find relating to promiscuity in homosexual men. 'I think people feel a certain invulnerability, especially young people, like this disease doesn't affect me. The publicity about the disease was very much the kind where it was easy to say, 'That isn't me. I'm not promiscuous.' Promiscuity, especially, was a piece where people could easily say, 'Well, I'm not. Promiscuous is more than I do.' If you have 300 partners a year, you can think you're not promiscuous if you know somebody who has 500. So it's all relative, and it was easy to feel that that isn't me.' You could find hets who have the same kind of partner volume. BFD. This kind of random generation of numbers that leads the nutty religious bigots (as you mentioned earlier). Grr. Bits damnit.

A benchmark provided by Intel seems to indicate that it performs certain operations faster than previous Pocket PCs, but in hands-on use we didn't find any significant difference in performance. I'm still not certain whether I should attribute performance limitation to the operating system (which hasn't been optimized for the new chips), applications (which likewise haven't be optimized), or simply that the new chip isn't that much better than the old StrongARM. But regardless, the e740 is an exceptional Pocket PC and one I don't hesitate to recommend to those looking for a high- powered PDA.

"Subject: fw : the gold buddha in 1957 , a monastery in thailand was being relocated and a group of monks was put in charge of moving a giant clay buddha . in the midst of the move one of the monks noticed a crack in the buddha . concerned about damaging the idol , the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task . when night came , one of the monks came to check on the giant statue . he shined his flashlight over the entire buddha . when he reached the crack he saw something reflected back at him . the monk , his curiosity aroused , got a hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay buddha . as he knocked off piece after piece of clay , the buddha got brighter and brighter . after hours of work , the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before him a huge solid - gold buddha . many historians believe the buddha had been covered with clay by thai monks several hundred years earlier before an attack by the burmese army . they covered the buddha to keep it from being stolen . in the attack all the monks were killed , so it wasn ' t until 1957 , when the monks were moving the giant statue , that the great treasure was discovered . like the buddha , our outer shell protects us from the word : our real treasure is hidden within . we human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay . all we need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our outer shell , piece by piece . could you be sitting on your own gold mine ? did you know the average american can retire a millionaire on his or her current income ? then , why don ' t they ? it ' s simple . they haven ' t been taught that they could . they are taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money work for them . they pay too much in taxes . they are wasting money every month and don ' t even realize it . in short , they are financially unhealthy . get a financial checkup and a free video on how to become ' financially fit for life ' and discover the gold within your current income . get your free 3 - point checkup and video now ! to unsubscribe , email removeme @ speededelivery . com with the subject ' remove ' . speededelivery . jordan commons tower 9350 south 150 east sandy , ut 84070 "

"Subject: The 'other' kind of work-experience ... Forwarded-by: Per Hammer  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia- pacific/2218715.stm Brothel duty for Australian MP A conservative Member of Parliament in Australia is set to spend the day as a 'slave' at one of Western Australia's most notorious brothels. Liberal Party member Barry Haase was 'won' in a charity auction after the madam of Langtree's brothel in the mining town of Kalgoorlie made the highest offer for his services for a day. [...] 'I hope he will leave with an informed decision on what Australian brothels are all about and it will help him in his political career to make informed decisions that he might not have been able to make before,' Ms Kenworthy said. Mr Haase, a member of Prime Minister John Howard's party seemed relaxed about the prospect of working in a brothel. 'You can't be half-hearted about fundraising for significant charities and I think I'm big enough to play the game,' he said.  "

"Subject: Daniel Berlinger has noticed that Mac software shops are starting     to move t URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020910.html Date: Not supplied Daniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _ over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) Robb Beal wrote[4]: 'Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's a Mac application a net plus? (No.)' Well _duh_. Your product would have to appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same amount of money. Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that magic 25 multiplier.

Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now,     some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP     networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless     networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs doing     something about it. And what     about ISP hackers? Could they break into your service provider?     Probably. Thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of     these leaks. Let Dan Tynan, our ISP guru, show you how.                         =09=09     =09=09=09            =09=09=09=09     =09=09=09=09     =09=09=09=09![3D''](3D'http://home.cnet.com/b.gif')            =09=09=09            =09=09                                          =09         =09=09  ![3D'advertisem=](3D'http://www.cnet.com/=)                                                <=     b class=3D'v1'> Quick links to Services & Prices from these companies                                =09=09     =09=09        =09=09       =09=09       =09=09       =09=09       =09=09        =09=09        =09=09            =09     =20     =09                             =09     =09     =09     =09=09![](3D'http://home.cnet.com/b.gif')     =09            =09     =09               ![3D'Crucial](3D'http://www.cnet.com/i/gl/new-cc.gif')                 ![](3D'http://home.cnet.com/=)                 ![](3D'http://home.cnet.com/b.gi=)     ![](3D'http://home.cnet.com/b.gif')     ![](3D'http://home.cnet.com/b.gif')     ![](3D'http://home.cnet.com/b.gif')     ![](3D'http://home.cnet.com/b.gi=)                           =09     =09     =09![3D''](3D'http://a.r.tv.com/cnet.1d/i/p/03210=)<=     /a>     =09![](3D'http://home.cnet.com/b.gif')     =095-megapixel shoot-out       Not all high-res cameras were create=     d alike.

In fact, both AT&T Broadband and Time Warner Cable have begun     campaigns to stop subscribers from sharing their accounts with     others at no charge. Also this week: we review Yahoo's new     dial-up service.                         Is your ISP safe from hackers?                 Surely, the folks who run your ISP have thought good and hard     about security issues, but should you count on their skills to     ward off intruders? Not wise, says our ISP expert. In this     week's column, Dan Tynan takes security matters into his own     hands and shows you how to protect yourself.                                             ![3D'The](3D'http://www.cnet.com/i/nl/ws/sub_scoop.gif')            ![](3D'http://www.cnet.com/i/nl/rule.gif')            Domain names                 A domain name provides an online identity and contact point for     your business, organization, or project.

"Subject: New Product Announcement NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT From: OUTSOURCE ENG.& MFG. INC. Sir/Madam; This note is to inform you of new watchdog board technology for maintaining continuous unattended operation of PC/Servers etc. that we have released for distribution. We are proud to announce Watchdog Control Center featuring MAM (Multiple Applications Monitor) capability. The key feature of this application enables you to monitor as many applications as you have resident on any computer as well as the operating system for continuous unattended operation. The Watchdog Control Center featuring MAM capability expands third party application 'control' of a Watchdog as access to the application's source code is no longer needed. Here is how it all works: Upon installation of the application and Watchdog, the user may select many configuration options, based on their model of Watchdog, to fit their operational needs. If the MAM feature is enabled, the user may select any executable program that they wish for monitoring. A lock up of the operating system or if any one of the selected applications is not running, the MAM feature, in conjunction with the Watchdog, will reset the system allowing for continuous operation. It's that simple! Watchdog Control Center is supported on most Microsoft Windows platforms (Win9x/WinNT/Win2k) and includes a Linux version for PCI Programmable Watchdogs. Watchdog Control Center Features: \- Automated installation \- Controls all Outsource Engineering Watchdogs \- User selectable Watchdog timeout period \- User selectable Watchdog stroke interval \- Multiple Application Monitoring Included on the Installation CD: \- Watchdog Control Center \- Watchdog Drivers \- Documentation For more information, please visit out website at http://www.outsrc-em.com/ or send an e-mail to sales@outsrc-em.com  "

"Subject: Wear Sunscreen 'Yes, and Eliza and I composed a precocious critique of the Constitution of the United States of America, too. We argued that it was as good a scheme for misery as any, since its success in keeping the common people reasonably happy and proud depended on the strength of the people themselves - and yet it described no practical machinery which would tend to make the people, as opposed to their elected representatives, strong. We said it was possible that the framers of the Constitution were blind to the beauty of persons who were without great wealth or powerful friends or public office, but who were nonetheless genuinely strong. We thought it was more likely, though, that the framers had not noticed that it was natural, and therefore almost inevitable, that human beings in extraordinary and enduring situations should think of themselves as composing new families. Eliza and I pointed out that this happened no less in democracies than in tyrannies, since human beings were the same the wide world over, and civilized only yesterday. Elected representatives, hence, could be expected to become members of the famous and powerful family of elected representatives - which would, perfectly naturally, make them wary and squeamish and stingy with respect to all the other sorts of families which, again, perfectly naturally, subdivided mankind. Eliza and I, thinking as halves of a single genius, proposed that the Constitution be amended so as to guarantee that every citizen, no matter how humble or crazy or incompetent or deformed, somehow be given membership in some family as covertly xenophobic and crafty as the one their public servants formed. Good for Eliza and me! Hi ho.' Kurt V Slapstick http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork  "
"Subject: earthviewer apps Re: whoa Gary Lawrence Murphy cynicizes: > Hmmm, just as I thought. In other words, it has no practical uses > whatsoever ;) Tourism is the world's largest industry. Using this to preview your travels, or figure out where you are, would be very valuable. Online gaming continues to grow. Screw 'Britannia', real-life Britain would be a fun world to wander/ conquer/explore virtually, in role- playing or real- time-strategy games. And of course, as James Rogers points out, it's an ideal display substrate for all sorts of other overlaid data. Maps are great, photrealistic 3-D maps of everywhere which can have many other static and dynamic datasets overlaid are spectacular. (Combining those last two thoughts: consider the static world map, in faded colors, with patches here-and-there covered by live webcams, stitched over the static info in bright colors... it'd be like the 'fog of war' view in games like Warcraft, over the real world.) \- Gordon  "

"Subject: One scam to rule them all.. One scam to rule them all, One scam to bind them, One scan to burn them all, And the stupidity bind them. (Yes, i'm ripping, and badly from LOTR) Alright, so NPR's All Things Considered had a wonderful story on the whole Nigerian 419 scams that seem to be running into my inbox constantly (Thanks FoRK!) Turns out, these 419 scams (419 is the statute in Nigeria that this particular form of fraud falls under) have actually snared a few people -- NPR reported to the tune of 100 million dollars over a few years, in the US alone. One website listed the 419 scam as being the 'third to fith largest industry in Nigeria' (1), netting billions of dollars from around the world. Its large enough to warrant a governmental investigation and a special number to call and report (to the secret service, no less) scam abuse. (2) Folks are apparently being held for ransom if they decide to go 'check out' the scam. (3). Listen to the NPR article (4). What's great about NPR is the commentary at the end. Turns out, this is all unbelievably common. The origination, at least to NPR's knowledge, starts with the scam elements being transposed from Nigeria, to London, England. Instead of the bereved widow of a Nigerian national, the originating con was directed to the 'heirs' of Sir Frances Drake's estate. If you were 'chosen' as an heir, you could contribute a portion of your money so that a fellow heir (and scam artist) could reclaim the monetary largess in the Court of England, by proving that Elizabeth I had nulled Sir Drake's will and taken his fortune as her own. Oscar Hartzell, the gent who started this scam, way back in the early 1800s, managed to gain quite a fortune, all on the backs of idiots. Sound familiar? A fool and his money, deserve to be parted.

Get what is rightfully yours. Program yourself for success and dare to think BIG. It sounds corny, but it's true. You'll never make it big if you don't have this belief system in place. MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability. It is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods. This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45people become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing. You may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch. Without hesitating Trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work. The audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response. 'That's why I'm sitting up here and you are all sitting out there!' With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business. Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again. In network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of others. The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave some thought and study to it. My name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!! In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's prior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for information on various business opportunities. All of the programs I received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one year. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it! But like I was saying, in December I received this program. I didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!! After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes. Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON. I could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I decided 'WHY NOT.' Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am telling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not 'rip-off' anyone, no matter how much money it cost me. Here is the basic version of what you need to do: Your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. Your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2 within 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO. Once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You will make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off, keep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build. Keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted. In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT #1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13, 1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making $50,000 in 90 days was done. By January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every day. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car. Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!! Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money! In order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal of 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of money, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out the programs and stay focused! That's the key. I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program, I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security. If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this a sign. I DID! -Sincerely, Jonathan Rourke P.S. Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME! A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal, could not have been created by an amateur. Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but it wasn't working. Finally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945. I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before. The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor. As the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER.' The traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to 'move up' or 'get rich'. Inflation will see to that. You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with 'NO RISK' and 'JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT.' You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name will be on everyone of them! Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! 'THINK ABOUT IT.' Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money! You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody Jacobs, Richmond, VA HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$ This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days. Before you say 'No Way!' please read this program carefully. This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making opportunity. Basically, this is what you do: As with all multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You do it privately in your own home, store, or office. This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere: This is what you MUST do. 1\. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell them if you don't have them). * For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME & RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem). *MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF ANY MAIL PROBLEMS! * When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five reports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. * Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. 2\. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps 'a' through 'g' or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will not work. a. Look below for the listing of available reports. b. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement and remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000! c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5. d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4. e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3 f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2. g. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position. Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy and paste method works well,. 3\. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction portion of this letter. Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet Connection and e-mail is FREE! To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much, much more. Here are two primary methods of building your downline: METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000 programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5% response. Using a good list, the response could be much better. Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people respond and order REPORT #2. Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The 0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5% response to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to 10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about level five! That's $500,000 alone! Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000 \+ $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!! REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM! DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many people will do just that and more! REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and e-mail software. METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 1\. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response. Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below: 1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50 2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500 3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)....... $5,000 4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) ....... $50,000 5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) ....... $500,000 THIS TOTALS - $555,550 Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of participants. THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report! AVAILABLE REPORTS *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND NAME *** * ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT ACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets of paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT) On one of those sheets of paper include: (a) the number & name of the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail address, and (c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider encounters problems). PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW: REPORT #1 'The Insiders Guide to Advertising for Free on the Internet' ORDER REPORT #1 FROM: Tony Goon 120 - 8511 Westminster Hwy. Richmond, BC.

About 50,000 new people get online every month! ******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS ******* * TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow the directions accurately. * Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when the orders start coming in. When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report. * ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE. * Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL! * ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED! ******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES ******* Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: Start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! By the time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your mailbox! For now, something simple, such as posting on message boards something to the effect of 'Would you like to know how to earn $50,000 working out of your house with NO initial investment? Email me with the keywords 'more info' to find out how. And, when they email you, send them this report in response! If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business! Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate in this program, answer one question ... DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE? If the answer is yes, please look at the following facts about this program: 1\. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO PRODUCE! 2\. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO SHIP! 3\. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST YOU ANYTHING TO ADVERTISE! 4\. YOU ARE UTILIZING THE POWER OF THE INTERNET AND THE POWER OF MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR PRODUCT ALL OVER THE WORLD! 5\. YOUR ONLY EXPENSES OTHER THAN YOUR INITIAL $25 INVESTMENT IS YOUR TIME! 6\. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INCOME YOU GENERATE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS PURE PROFIT! 7\. THIS PROGRAM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER. ******* TESTIMONIALS******* This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. -Steven Bardfield, Portland, OR My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail.' I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby. ' I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL. The. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached several times before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in. -Charles Morris, Esq. Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return. -Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ... I didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the first try!! -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy spending! -Kerry Ford, Centerport, NY IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! Take 5 minutes to Change Your Future!

this is critical to your success . take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each ) . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 5 million e - mail sent out . the 0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the reason for the ' cash ' is not because this is illegal or somehow ' wrong ' . it is simply about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net order report # 1 from : y . l . wong p . o . box no . 71819 kowloon central post office hong kong report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net order report # 2 from : martin veronneau c . p . 70058 laval , quebec h 7 r 5 z 2 canada report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net order report # 3 from : francis kidd p . o . box 209 homestead , pa 15120 usa report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net order report # 4 from : m . l . frayser p . o . box 61432 fort myers , fl 33906 usa report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free order report # 5 from : stone evans 600 n . pearl , suite gl 03 dallas , tx 75201 usa $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in !

"Subject: warchalking Hobos in the depression used to use this technique to know if they could find a meal or a bed and how friendly the residents were to begging. This showed up on sladhdot in June. It'll be interesting to see what the parallel sign is for the Hobo sign that representing a meal or bed if threatened. Can you imagine threatening someone to get your wireless? Another phenomenon is Internet connection sharing which is freely available on most modern OSs. It's a very easy way to share a $6/24hour period wireless conneciton in the San Jose airport among dozens of your favorite friends. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2197252.stm http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf Friday, 16 August, 2002, 11:42 GMT 12:42 UK FBI warns about wireless craze Some FBI agents are worried about warchalking Well-meaning wireless activists have caught the attention of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. One of its agents has issued a warning about the popular practice of using chalk marks to show the location of wireless networks. The marks, or 'warchalks', are cropping up in cities and suburbs across the world. The FBI is now telling companies that, if they see the chalk marks outside their offices, they should check the security of wireless networks and ensure they remain closed to outsiders. Top marks The warchalking phenomena is only a couple of months old but it has generated a huge amount of interest. The idea behind warchalking is to use a standardised set of symbols to mark the existence of wireless networks that anyone can use to go online. Many community groups and local governments, and even some public-spirited companies, are setting up wireless nodes that give people fast net access. This symbol denotes a closed wireless node The wireless networks replace computer cables with radio and are usually very easy to set up and connect to. Before now many curious hackers have gone on 'wardriving' expeditions which involve them driving around an area logging the location of the wireless networks. Many companies using wireless do not do enough to make them secure and stop people outside the organisation using them. So the FBI is issuing advice to companies to be on the lookout for warchalk marks as a pointer to the security of their wireless network. 'If you notice these symbols at your place of business, it is likely your network has been identified publicly,' warns the guidance from the FBI. Scare stories? The agent who circulated the warning in Pittsburgh said it was not an official FBI advisory or policy but was information worth passing on. He urged anyone using a wireless network to ensure that it was secure and used only by those a company wants to access it. Warchalkers have questioned the scare stories surrounding the phenomena, saying that anyone with malicious intent is unlikely to publicly mark their target. The phrases 'wardriving' and 'warchalking' derive from the early days of computer hacking when curious users programmed their computers to search for all phone lines that returned data tones. The exhaustive searching was known as 'wardialling'. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork  "

Jobs used his keynote speech at the Macworld trade show here to make a flurry of other announcements as well, such as details about new syncing software, the next update to OS X and the end of free iTools. The most dramatic announcement focused on iPod. The new players include ones built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system.

The deal calls for Salt Lake City-based SBI to hire some of Scient's employees and to provide up to $4.9 million in financing, pending completion of the asset acquisition. Scient has been struggling for some time now. Once a dot-com darling, the company recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split. The company and SBI said they expect the bankruptcy court to approve the deal, adding that financing 'will allow Scient to continue to deliver services to its clients without interruption until court approval of SBI's acquisition is received.'

That's what users of the company's free e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the word 'mocha' and discover that while in transit, 'mocha' mysteriously changes to 'espresso.' To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as 'mocha' that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript. The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as 'Web enhanced' can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.

Unisys' new Aries servers accommodate as many as 16 Itanium 2 or Xeon processors and cost between $75,000 and $300,000, said Mark Fevertson, Unisys' vice president of server marketing. It joins the Orion line, which can use up to 32 Xeon or Itanium 2 processors and has been on sale for about two years at a cost between $140,000 and $700,000.

The promotion, which runs through Sept. 30, entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. Microsoft is also offering two new pieces of downloadable software: one that lets Palm handhelds synchronize directly with Office v. X and another that lets the Macintosh view programs running on a Windows PC or server.

The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the details of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new architecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images, according to sources. The fastest versions of the new chips will offer considerably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving ATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999-- comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two will remain close.

Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new= iPod digital- audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.  The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that u= se Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the exi= sting 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with= a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod fo= r $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three m= odels for Windows users with MusicMatch software.  As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel mon= itor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolut= ion versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.  Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will = be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with = improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change t= he background photo as often as every 5 seconds.  But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a ch= eap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a disc= ounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to curr= ent users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will h= ave to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating syst= em for the retail price of $129.  Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qu= alitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions s= hare the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and ser= vices, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvou= s, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.  Apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its iTools Web serv= ices from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans t= o charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web service= s was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a= service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other featu= res.  Despite iTool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell w= ith the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture= . Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously = free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when= free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to= form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently= .  To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of= services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organiz= ed than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However,= an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode wel= l for the program.  Microsoft's moves   Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to offer a= rebate for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software= bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in re= bate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for= those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.  The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have no= t met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000= copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the = program went on sale last November.  Microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third co= llection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after= a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, c= ontains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the o= perating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 co= uld be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security f= ixes are available as separate downloads.  Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Micro= soft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has shut down a = site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. T= he company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java = inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the= forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.  Somebody's watching you   You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yah= oo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter= to swap out a handful of words such as 'mocha' and 'eval' that= pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.  The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as 'Web enhanced' can contai= n JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaS= cript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser= to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for = example.  'Mocha' is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced = e-mail. Typing 'mocha:' into the location bar of the Netscape browser will = open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which comma= nds can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command = line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person'= s knowledge.  On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. g= overnment is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious acti= vity in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled mor= e details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan= to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or = suspicious behavior.  'The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the dail= y course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual= or suspicious activity in public places,' according to the TIPS Web site. = But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan,= fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possib= ly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.

The lawsuits prevented the Forest Service from implementation of any project that involved tree removal. These projects were designed to address the tree and undergrowth density that resulted from previous management policies. In other words, Forest Service projects to clean up the mess resulting from their previous forest management practices are prevented by tree lover lawsuits. > 40 years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff > left to burn.

There are very few replacement forests planted these days. Those that are, are mostly planted on private land as commercial tree farms.

"Subject: commercialization of nasa technology hey , i thought you might like to take a look at viaspace the cohen report viaspace was founded in 1998 as a spin - off of the caltech / nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) to transform technologies originally developed for space and defense markets into profitable commercial enterprises . viaspace seeks opportunities in high growth markets delivering on problems with growing global relevance by leveraging unique expertise not available elsewhere in the commercial world . viaspace sees a compelling business opportunity in the homeland security public safety and fuel cell markets . viaspace target markets are in excess of $ 100 b / yr and growing with a cagr of over 20 % . in the past six years viaspace has created three companies , spectrasensors , qwip technologies and vialogy corp . their websites provide a background on the commercialization of nasa technology , ( spectrasensors . com , qwip . com , vialogy . com ) . the company ' s current focus is on three subsidiaries , direct methanol fuel cell , arroyo sciences and ionfinity . direct liquid methanol fuel cell direct methanol fuel cell corporation ( dmfcc ) will provide disposable methanol fuel cell cartridges for tomorrow ' s fuel cell - powered portable electronic devices such as laptop computers and cell phones . methanol fuel cells ( dfmc ) are expected to replace lithium ion batteries in portable electronic devices . a dfmc can power a laptop for up to 10 hours on a disposable cartridge that costs $ 2 to $ 3 . a smaller cartridge can power a cell phone for up to 3 weeks . we believe consumers will spend a few extra dollars for the convenience of keeping their cell phones and other electronic devices operating . as a disposable product , it generates recurring revenue for dmfcc . the technology is protected by over 70 issued and pending patents . toshiba , nec , sanyo , and samsung have unveiled prototype fuel cell powered products that more than double the operating time over existing battery technology . dmfcc has opened a tokyo office to work closely with japanese manufacturers . arroyo sciences , inc . arroyo focuses on the fusion of radio frequency , nuclear and electromagnetic imaging to deliver information products in transportation , supply chain , security , logistics assurance and first responder safety markets . the micro tracker product enables a wireless tracking for first responders in hazardous environments . this product combines radio frequency identification ( rfid ) tags , wireless digital communications , ground positioning satellite ( gps ) , data for 2 - d and 3 - d geolocation determination , geographic information system ( gis ) and sensor technologies . real - time processing of many high data content inputs is required for the instantaneous assessment of danger . applications include improved safety for fire department personnel in emergency situations , improved coordination of multi - agency deployments and extended operations in hazardous environments . the cobra product uses the imaging and sensing technology to provide early threat indicators for coastal surveillance and public infrastructure protection such as ports , power plants , airports , and telecommunication facilities . real time sensory and image data is processed and software is customized to discriminate between friend and foe . deepscan is a software system that provides automatic analysis of air and seaport cargo containers based on x -

"Subject: business intent Dear Sir, I am Stanley Woodwork, the secetary of Africa White farmers co- operation (AWFC) OF Zimbabwe. After the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president Mr. Robert Mugabe won the presidential election, the government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. This programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white African farmers for redistribution to black africans. This programme has attracted worldwide condemnation from world leaders including British prime minister,mr Tony Blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of victimization and physical abuse. Two weeks ago, our headquartes in Harare was attacked and looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. Fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which belong to the co-operation. This cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government. Now I have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. The cash in question is US$46Million dollars. Once I can get your commitment and sincerity of investing this funds on our behalf then I would proceed to get the funds freighted to Europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us. You do not have anything to worry about as I would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free. You would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe. Please get back to me if you can be of assistance and I would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government. I expect 100% confidentiality and your prompt response to this mail so as to proceed.you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork@email.com Kind regards, Stanley Woodwork.  "

"Subject: AmeriCorpsVISTA The pay's not good (9,300 a year), but there is insurance, a 4,700 (I think) off a student loan, or for future education, and non-compete status for any govt. job after a year's service. I moved to New Orleans yesterday, and I should be flying to DC in about a month to start the AmeriCorps training. I'll be setting up a community technology center which will be used to teach computer literacy skills to low income folks (just, like, learning MS shit (yeah yeah, wtf am i doing? I know.)) so that they can possibly find better jobs. I'm sure I'll be doing all sorts of other things too, like helping folks with their taxes, writing grants, etc. The website is www.americorps.org. There are -all- sorts of jobs all over the country, so if someone out there can survive on the small salary, it's something s/he might want to take a look at. Since Xi is in college and getting grants + scholarship + child support from dad, my load has gone down terrifically. The IRS is after me for money I didn't make on the stock market, so it's a way to at least get into a situation where they will have to understand that yes, they will have to wait. But bottom line benefit and motivation is the feelgood that ya get when you do this type of job. I'm up for some of that.

"Subject:  dear sir / madam , i beg you to carefully go through this email and should it not meet your business or personal ethics , please accept my apologies in advance . my name is david roberts , the chief executive of private clients international of the barclays group with head office at 54 lombard street , london ec 3 p 3 ah . i am writing this letter to solicit for your support and assistance to carry out a project concerning a late customer of the bank by name dr . victor morgan , an oil magnet and philanthropist who died on the 14 th of june 2002 in the london hospital after being involved in fatal car crash which also claimed the life of his wife and two sons . lying in his inactive account in one of our branches is the sum of thirty million united states dollars . ever since he died the bank has placed a stop on all transactions on this account pending when his next of kin would come forward for necessary actions , identification and collection . unfortunately from our investigations and confirmations from his attorney he has no family members who are aware of the existence of the money and as such , we have decided to do business with you . if you stand in as the beneficiary of this funds the money will be released to you , after the due processes have being followed . obviously we do not want this money to go into the bank treasury because the banking law and guideline stipulates that if such fund remains unclaimed for 3 years , the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed debt . this would not take too much time to get done as his lawyer already has the necessary letters of administration and court orders from the british high court which are part of the documents required by the barclays bank to process fund release approvals . to do this work 75 % of the money will be for our end , 20 % will be for you while 5 % will be for any xpenses incurred during the transaction . please reach me at my private email address above , if willing to do business with us . thanks and regards , david roberts . disclaimer : this message contains confidential information and is intended only for specified addressee . if you are not the named addressee you should not disseminate , distribute or copy this e - mail . the sender therefore does not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contents of this message , which arise as a result of e - mail transmission . please note that we reserve the right to monitor and read any emails sent and received by the barclays group under the telecommunications ( lawful business practice ) ( interception of communications ) regulations 2000 .

"Subject: Real Money Maker for Real! Dear Friends & Future Millionaire: AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! ================================================== BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.' Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. =================================================== Here is another testimonial: 'This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.'' More testimonials later but first, ===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTUREREFERENCE ====== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS: =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. === When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happen to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! ========================================================== **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ========================================================== Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2 . Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 ... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ========================================================= REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ======================================================= Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receivethe report. =========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ==================================================== REPORT # 1: 'The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net' Order Report #1 from: A. Christ 1208 Allendale Rd. Mechanicsburg, PA 17055 ___________________________________________________________ REPORT # 2: 'The Insider's Guide to Sending Bulk e-mail on the Net' Order Report # 2 from: Michael P. 2508 Robin Altus, OK 73521 USA ____________________________________________________________ REPORT # 3: 'Secret to Multilevel Marketing on the Net' Order Report # 3 from : D. J. 16 Northcrest Dr. London, ONTARIO, CANADA N5X 3V8 __________________________________________________________ REPORT # 4: 'How to Become a Millionaire Utilizing MLM & the Net' Order Report # 4 from: E. Zurbrigg RR #1 St. Marys, ON, Canada N4X 1C4 ____________________________________________________________ REPORT #5: 'How to Send Out 0ne Million e-mails for Free' Order Report # 5 from: A. Ebert R. R. #4 Thamesford, Ontario, Canada N0M 2M0 ____________________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. === Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ====================================================== FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! ============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ 'My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ====================================================== ''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.' Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ======================================================= ''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.' Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ======================================================= ''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.'.

Alberta, and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces, is definitely not happy with the current arrangement. Some of this has to do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured. When I was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over several distinct issues. The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in Ottawa. While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token representation in the federal government. While I'm not clear on exactly how the government works up there, representation is not entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire province of Alberta. The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having fewer people. Or something like that. The Canadian government is less restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces, Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities. It is essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the inter-mountain West of the US. Unlike the US case though, the rest of Canada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax dollars from Alberta. OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive. I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little fuzzy on some of the details. What I do know is that on average the Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.

"Subject: Bits for posterity: Astronomical sleuthing From: Donald Eastlake 3rd                     July 16, 2002     By Yonder Blessed Moon, Sleuths Decode Life and Art     By LEON JAROFF          On its way back from the Pacific island of Tinian, where it had     delivered the uranium core for the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima,     the heavy cruiser Indianapolis was torpedoed by the Japanese submarine     I-58 and sent to the bottom of the Philippine Sea. It was one of the     worst disasters in American naval history; only 317 of its nearly 1,200     crew members survived.          Now experts at Southwest Texas State University have given that tragic     story a startling new twist.          It was the moon, they say, that sank the Indianapolis. Or anyway, they     write in the July issue of Sky & Telescope, it was the moon that made     the sinking possible.          Using astronomical computer programs, records and weather reports, as     well as the known coordinates and running speeds of the ship and the     submarine that sank it, the authors determined that when the I-58     surfaced, it was perfectly aligned, west to east, with the cruiser. And,     they said, a three-quarter moon had just emerged from behind the clouds.          Looking across the moonlit water, an I-58 crewman spotted the ship     silhouetted against the sky, 10.3 miles away. Half an hour later, six     torpedoes sent it to the bottom.          'It was sheer chance,' said Dr. Donald Olson, an astronomer. 'Without     that alignment with the moon, the lookouts would not have spotted the     cruiser, especially at that distance.'          With Russell Doescher, a physics lecturer, Dr. Olson conducts a     university honors course called 'Astronomy in Art, History and     Literature.' In the last 15 years, he has pinpointed the time and place     of the rendering of art masterpieces, given new interpretations of     astronomical references in Chaucer and revealed the decisive role of the     moon in military and other encounters.          Two years ago, for example, Dr. Olson turned his attention to the bright     star in van Gogh's 'White House at Night.' He and some students went to     Auvers, France, where van Gogh created his final works, and searched     until they found the house, largely unchanged. Sifting through letters     from van Gogh to his brother, Dr. Olson found that the painting was     completed in June 1890.          Noting the orientation of the house in the painting, he determined where     van Gogh had set his easel and what section of the sky he had portrayed,     and from the lighting and shadows, he established that the house had     been illuminated by the setting sun. His computer analysis then     identified the 'star.' It was Venus, which in early evening in mid-June     had occupied that part of the sky.          A final check of local weather records pinpointed the actual date van     Gogh had composed the painting, June 16, the only clear day in the     middle of the month that year.          Dr. Olson has also turned his attention to Shakespeare, intrigued by the     opening of 'Hamlet,' when guards on the ramparts of Elsinor refer to the     'star that's westward from the pole had made his course to illume that     part of heaven where now it burns.' From the guards' description, the     season and the time, other astronomers had suggested several bright     stars as possibilities, but Dr. Olson's calculations placed it in the     constellation Cassiopeia, which lacks any notably luminous stars.          Pondering this problem on a trip with his wife, Dr. Olson was suddenly     inspired. He was aware that in 1572, a supernova, called Tycho's star,     for the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, suddenly flamed in Cassiopeia,     creating a worldwide sensation. Shakespeare, 8 at the time, would     certainly have recalled the event, and his memory was probably refreshed     by the description of the supernova in a history book that was the     source of some of his best-known plays.          Dr. Olson has no doubt that the star that glared above Elsinor that     night was Tycho's, and he has an impressive record of other     astronomy-based sleuthing.          Aware that the photographer Ansel Adams often neglected to date his     negatives, Dr. Olson set out to find when Adams had shot his classic     'Moon and Half Dome.' At Yosemite, Dr. Olson and his students found     Adams's vantage point, studied the location, phase and features of the     moon in the photograph, plus the shadows on the Dome, snow on the peak     and other clues, and then announced that the picture had been taken at     4:14 p.m., Dec. 28, 1960.          Then, Dr. Olson calculated that the setting would be virtually identical     at 4:05 p.m. on Dec. 13, 1994. On that day Adams's daughter-in-law     visited Yosemite and was photographed holding a print of 'Moon and the     Half Dome' in the foreground of an eerily similar view of the actual     moon and the Half Dome.          Analyzing Chaucer's works, Dr. Olson has confirmed that a particularly     rapid movement of the moon described in 'The Merchant's Tale' occurred     in April 1389. And in 'The Franklin's Tale,' Chaucer's description of     the heavenly alignment that caused an exceptionally high tide on the     Brittany coast, convinced Dr. Olson that Chaucer was an advanced amateur     astronomer.          Then there was Paul Revere. On his way to saddle up for his famous ride,     how did he manage to row undetected past a British warship on a moonlit     night in Boston Harbor? Dr. Olson's computer program revealed that,     while the moon was nearly full that night, it was unusually close to the     southern horizon and did not illuminate Revere's boat.          Dr. Olson's proudest achievement was explaining 'the tide that failed'     in the bloody Marine Corps landing at Tarawa atoll on Nov. 20, 1943.     Planners had expected a tide to provide a water depth of five feet over     a reef some 600 yards from shore, allowing larger landing craft, with     drafts of at least four feet, to pass.          But that day and the next, in the words of some observers, 'the ocean     just sat there,' providing neither low tide nor high tide and leaving a     mean depth of three feet over the reef. The craft grounded on the edge     of the reef, and many marines were killed or injured as they waded 600     yards to the shore, rifles over their heads, in the face of machine-gun     fire from the Japanese.          Asked by a former marine about the tidal phenomenon, Dr. Olson spent six     months researching and mastering tidal theory and discovered that the     military planners were aware that they had to contend with a 'neap'     tide. This phenomenon occurs twice a month when the moon is near its     first or last quarter, because the countering tug of the sun causes     water levels to deviate less.          But that day, the moon was also almost at its farthest point from earth     and exerted even less pull, leaving the waters relatively undisturbed     and the marines in trouble.          'I'm not in the least blaming the planners,' Dr. Olson said, explaining     that the techniques used in accurately determining tides hadn't been     applied to the waters at Tarawa.          Indeed, he modestly claims, by using his computer program, 'We can     calculate the tides in any port in the world on any day in history.'          Yet Dr. Olson's greatest satisfaction seems to stem from his     interdisciplinary approach to astronomical sleuthing. 'I have thought     about van Gogh, about Shakespeare and Chaucer,' he says, 'and that has     made my life as a scientist much richer.'     http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork                 "

"Subject: Re: storage bits At Fermi (yes I'm back there; long story), we're buying 4U systems like the fiscal year is ending. We have ~20 ASA IR4US1 systems (not pushing them, there are some other similar units available), with 60 more on order. They're 2-1/2 TB for $10K, although we add a separate IDE or SCSI system disk, because the 3Ware RAID controllers can saturate. Intel SDS2 motherboard, 2 1.4GHz P3s, 2 GB ram, 2 3Ware 7850 Raid controllers, 16 160GB Maxtors, SysKonnect gigabit enet, Fermi RedHat 7.3. http://www.asacomputers.com/cgi- bin/index.fcg?action=displayscreen&templateid;=25 There's some interesting info at: http://mit.fnal.gov/~msn/cdf/caf/server_evaluation.html We've decided to go with XFS (which Linus has just merged into the 2.5 tree), mostly because none of the other journaled fs's can maintain >30 GB/s rates with a nearly full filesystem (mostly GB files) with random deletions (we use these systems for caching our 2 petabyte tape store). Ext3 almost did it but dropped from from ~38MB/s to 10 with random deletions, and didn't want to do direct io at all. Only concern is an occasional system lock-up we haven't chased down yet. A load avg > 100 is always a patio of fun. Oddly, even fairly beefy systems like these will breathe hard to keep up with the new STK 9940B tape drives, which crank along at a steady 30GB/s. And you oldforktimers will remember 'doofus' my old file server system. It would only take 2.1' of rackspace now, instead of 14 racks. Cheers, Wayne  "

Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your   > next door neighbor or your cat.  Write your sales letter   > just like you are writing it to them personally.

Keep your   > sales letters personal, because one person at a time is   > going to read them. >>  >> 2) Use an illustration to get your point across.  In my   > sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on   > the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must   > constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our   > businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily   > making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback   > across Montana on a grizzly bear.  Leads have read of how   > getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively   > marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home   > a solid message.  Tell stories that illustrate a point you   > are trying to make.  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an   > account from the 'real world.'  It effectively creates   > interest and further establishes the point. >>  >> 3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first   > line.  Your first line of the sales letter should   > immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know   > more.  Go back to the beginning of this article.  The first   > words were, 'It's true.'  I can guarantee you that either   > consciously or subconsciously you thought 'What's true?'   > Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking   > about.  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8   > paragraphs into this article.  Carefully craft your first   > line.  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,   > you've got a winner. >>  >> 4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted   > lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use   > bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or   > service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.   > Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight   > each line and create a sense of more length to the list. >>  >> 5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.  Shortly after   > your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet   > list of benefits to absorb.  Hit them with your best shot.   > Pull out the big guns and stress 'just a few of' the most   > important things the reader will discover.  By offering a   > killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically   > create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad   > copy.  After all, if they are already interested after the   > first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to   > finding out even more reasons why your product or service   > will aid them. >>  >> 6) Just let it all flow out.  Write down everything that   > enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You   > can edit it later.  If you just sit and start writing   > everything you know about your product or service and how it   > will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much   > information floods your mind.  Write it ALL down.  Then read   > through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to   > many of the points.  Edit it after you have exhausted all   > of your ideas. >>  >> 7) Make your sales letter personal.  Make sure that the   > words 'you' and 'your' are at least 4:1 over 'I' and 'my.'   > Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not   > yourself.  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,   > but it's something like this, 'I don't care a thing about   > your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.'  Leads aren't   > interested in you or your products, they are interested in   > themselves and their wants and needs.  When you are finished   > with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test   > webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see   > what the ratio between 'you' and 'your' versus references to   > 'I,' 'me,' 'my,' etc.  It's a free service.  Make sure it's   > at least 4:1 in favor of the customer. >>  >> 8) Write like you speak.  Forget all of those rules that   > your grammar teacher taught you.  Write your sales letters   > in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.   > Don't be afraid to begin sentences with 'And' or 'Because.'   > Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.   > Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great   > American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest   > Hemingway. >>  >> 9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.   > Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.  Use short   > paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be   > afraid to use short sentences.  Like this one. >>  >> Or this.  >>  >> See what I mean?  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of   > the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often   > force the reader to get distracted. >>  >> 10)  Stress the benefits, not the features.  Again,   > readers want the burning question answered, 'What's in it   > for  me?'  What need is it going to meet? What want is it   > going to fill?  How is your product or service going to be   > of value or benefit to the reader?  Spell it out.  Don't   > focus on the features of your product or service , but   > rather how those features will add value to the life of your   > reader. >>  >> For example:  If you are selling automobile tires, you may   > very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,   > but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I   > do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while   > we are traveling.  So, instead of focusing on your selection,   > you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe   > because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not   > selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress   > the benefits, not the features. >>  >> 11) Keep the reader interested.  Some sales letters read   > like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can   > perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are   > filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to   > understand.  Unless you are writing to a very targeted   > audience, avoid using technical language that many readers   > might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language   > and information that are easy to understand and follow. >>  >> 12) Target your sales letter.  When you are finished with   > your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a   > specific audience.  For example: If you are selling a 'work   > at home' product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding   > words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards   > women who are homemakers.  Then, rewrite the same sales   > letter and target it to college students.  Write another   > letter targeting senior citizens.  Still another could be   > written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income   > during summer vacation.  The possibilities are endless. >>  >> All you need to do is add a few words here and there in   > your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service   > is specifically designed for a target audience. 'Work only   > 5 hours a week,' would become 'College Students, work only   > 5 hours a week.'  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload   > all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website   > (you could easily target 100's of groups). >>  >> Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted   > mediums.  You could advertise the 'College Students' page   > in a campus ezine.  The 'Senior Citizens' page could be   > advertised at a retirement community message board. >>  >> By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally   > open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product   > to.  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a   > match made for them. >>  >> 13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.  Use short sentences   > and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention   > grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One   > thing that I have always found to work very well in sales   > letters... >>  >>      ...is to use a pause like this.  >>  >> Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting   > to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,   > if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on   > several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook   > line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. 'Let's   > get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK   > HERE to continue.' >>  >> 14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.  When the   > customer purchases your product, they will generate 'a flood   > of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.'   > If they do not order today, then they will 'feel like a cat   > that let the mouse get away.'  Use words to create a picture   > in the readers' mind.  When you think of Superman, what   > comes to mind?  Immediately, we remember that he is 'faster   > than a speeding bullet.'  'More powerful than a locomotive.'   > 'Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.' See how   > word pictures stick in our minds? >>  >> 15) Focus on one product or service.  Don't try to sell   > your customer multiple products at the same time. It only   > confuses the reader.  Keep your ad copy directed at one   > specific product or service.  Then, use other products and   > services as back-end products. >>  >> 16) Make it stand out.  Don't kid yourself.  There are   > hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the   > same thing you are doing.  How will you stand out among the   > crowd?  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must   > breathe of originality.  Your product or service is   > different. It's not like all of the rest.  It is unique.   > Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the   > competition.  It must create a feeling of 'You won't find   > this anywhere else.' >>  >> 17) Be believable. 'Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!'   > Delete.  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or   > something?  Get real.  Don't make outrageous claims that   > are obviously not the truth.  You'll ruin your reputation.   > Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be   > reversed.  Once you have been branded a liar, you will   > NEVER be anything but a liar.  It doesn't matter if you   > launch the most respectable, honest business available   > anywhere, people will always have doubt because they   > remember the crazy stuff you've said before.  Be believable.   > Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth. >>  >> 18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but   > rather be EXACT.  Instead of 'over 100 tips for losing   > weight' use '124 tips for losing weight.' By generalizing   > information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's   > mind.  'What am I really getting here?  Does he even know?'   > When you use specific information, the reader begins to   > think, 'This person must have counted.  I know exactly what   > I can expect.'  'Platitudes and generalities roll off the   > human understanding like water from a duck,' wrote Claude   > Hopkins in his classic book 'Scientific Advertising.' 'They   > leave no impression whatsoever.' >>  >> 19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would   > want to know about your product or service.  Answer all of   > their questions, anything they would want to consider before   > making a purchase.  Think about it from their point of view.   > Ask yourself, 'Why wouldn't I buy this?'  Then, address that   > in your sales letter.  Remove anything that would keep the   > reader from making the purchase. >>  >> 20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.  Share actual   > excerpts from what your current customers are saying about   > your product or service. Many websites have an entire   > section or even a separate page that has endorsements and   > compliments listed.  Satisfied customers remove some of the   > doubt in the mind of the reader.  'If these people have   > found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I   > probably will too.'  Especially effective are testimonials   > from respected, well known 'authorities' within your target   > field. >>  >> 21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.   > A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your   > ad copy.  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.  A well-   > placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings   > them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next   > paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on   > your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.  They are   > that important. >>  >> 22) Avoid asking stupid questions.  'Wouldn't you like to   > make $1,000,000 a year?' 'Doesn't that sound great?' 'Would   > you like to be as successful as I am?'  Avoid any question   > that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them   > feel like they are inferior. >>  >> 23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.   > If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a   > purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try   > to influence them to buy in the future.  By offering a free   > item, you can  request their email address in order to   > obtain the freebie.  By doing this, you can now follow-up   > with the customer for a potential future sale.   > Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having   > your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.   > And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful   > product or service which impresses the customer, they   > probably will be back as a customer soon. >>  >> 24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.  One of the things   > that I have found very effective in writing sales letters   > is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product   > I am offering.  Ginsu made this one famous. They were   > selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial   > was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table   > it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality   > bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages   > the credibility of your main offer. >>  >> 25) Use connective phrases like 'But wait, there's more'   > and 'But that's not all.'  These phrases effectively lead   > the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly   > when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or   > leads into bonus items.  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE   > value and benefits to the reader. >>  >> 26) Always include a deadline.  By including a deadline,   > you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.   > 'If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the   > bonuses.'  'Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,   > I've got to hurry.'  Let the customer know what they will   > be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,   > they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will   > miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines   > are very effective.  Every sales letter should have one. >>  >> 27) Tell them exactly how to order.  Be clear as to the   > order process. Point them towards the order link.  Tell   > them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,   > etc.)  Make this process as simple and clear as can be.   > If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue. >>  >> 28)  Explain when the product will be delivered.  How   > quickly will the order be processed?  When will the order be   > available?  Let the customer know exactly what they can   > expect when they place their order.  The more specific you   > can be here, the better.  Let them know that you have a   > system in place.  'Operators are standing by.'  Their order   > will be handled properly.  Tell them. >>  >> 29) Offer a money back guarantee.  Take away their last   > reason to hold back.  Offer a 'no questions asked' 30 day   > guarantee.  Most people may not realize this, but in most   > cases, it's the law of the land.  You are REQUIRED to give   > them their money back if they are not satisfied with the   > product or service.  Since it's the law anyway, why not make   > it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your   > product or service RISK-FREE. >>  >> 30) Instruct them to respond immediately.  Many people   > just need to read those words, 'Act Now!'  'Order today!'   > 'Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.'  You've got them   > this far, now tell them what you want them to do.  Get them   > to 'Act Fast!'  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial   > on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right   > way? >>  >> 31) Include a post script.  People will always read the   > P.S.  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT   > parts of your sales letter. Why?  Because in many cases the   > visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the   > end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.  A   > P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they   > see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed   > description of what they will receive for their money. Use   > your P.S. to restate your offer in detail. >>  >> 32) Include a second post script.  You better believe   > if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.  Use   > this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer   > another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would   > make them want to order.  I guarantee you they will read it. >>  >> Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see   > a significant increase in the amount of responses you   > receive from your sales letters.  In fact, it would be   > impossible for your responses to not improve.   >   >>  >> Copyright 2000 Jimmy D. Brown.

ANYONE can earn a living online.  Really, they   > can.  But, it takes several very important components to   > join the 5% who are successful on the web. >>  >>      One of those necessities is a website.  >>  >>      Now, your website does one of two things...  >>  >>      ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.  >>  >> For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do   > not produce results. >>  >> And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.   > Poor sales letters. >>  >> Does your website convince people to make a purchase?   > If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into   > your sales letter... >>  >> 1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.   > Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your   > sales letter to.  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your   > next door neighbor or your cat.  Write your sales letter   > just like you are writing it to them personally.  Why?   > Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will   > seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.   > Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going   > to be read to an audience rather than one person.  Keep your   > sales letters personal, because one person at a time is   > going to read them. >>  >> 2) Use an illustration to get your point across.  In my   > sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on   > the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must   > constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our   > businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily   > making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback   > across Montana on a grizzly bear.  Leads have read of how   > getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively   > marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home   > a solid message.  Tell stories that illustrate a point you   > are trying to make.  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an   > account from the 'real world.'  It effectively creates   > interest and further establishes the point. >>  >> 3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first   > line.  Your first line of the sales letter should   > immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know   > more.  Go back to the beginning of this article.  The first   > words were, 'It's true.'  I can guarantee you that either   > consciously or subconsciously you thought 'What's true?'   > Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking   > about.  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8   > paragraphs into this article.  Carefully craft your first   > line.  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,   > you've got a winner. >>  >> 4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted   > lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use   > bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or   > service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.   > Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight   > each line and create a sense of more length to the list. >>  >> 5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.  Shortly after   > your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet   > list of benefits to absorb.  Hit them with your best shot.   > Pull out the big guns and stress 'just a few of' the most   > important things the reader will discover.  By offering a   > killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically   > create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad   > copy.  After all, if they are already interested after the   > first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to   > finding out even more reasons why your product or service   > will aid them. >>  >> 6) Just let it all flow out.  Write down everything that   > enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You   > can edit it later.  If you just sit and start writing   > everything you know about your product or service and how it   > will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much   > information floods your mind.  Write it ALL down.  Then read   > through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to   > many of the points.  Edit it after you have exhausted all   > of your ideas. >>  >> 7) Make your sales letter personal.  Make sure that the   > words 'you' and 'your' are at least 4:1 over 'I' and 'my.'   > Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not   > yourself.  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,   > but it's something like this, 'I don't care a thing about   > your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.'  Leads aren't   > interested in you or your products, they are interested in   > themselves and their wants and needs.  When you are finished   > with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test   > webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see   > what the ratio between 'you' and 'your' versus references to   > 'I,' 'me,' 'my,' etc.  It's a free service.  Make sure it's   > at least 4:1 in favor of the customer. >>  >> 8) Write like you speak.  Forget all of those rules that   > your grammar teacher taught you.  Write your sales letters   > in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.   > Don't be afraid to begin sentences with 'And' or 'Because.'   > Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.   > Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great   > American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest   > Hemingway. >>  >> 9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.   > Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.  Use short   > paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be   > afraid to use short sentences.  Like this one. >>  >> Or this.  >>  >> See what I mean?  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of   > the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often   > force the reader to get distracted. >>  >> 10)  Stress the benefits, not the features.  Again,   > readers want the burning question answered, 'What's in it   > for  me?'  What need is it going to meet? What want is it   > going to fill?  How is your product or service going to be   > of value or benefit to the reader?  Spell it out.  Don't   > focus on the features of your product or service , but   > rather how those features will add value to the life of your   > reader. >>  >> For example:  If you are selling automobile tires, you may   > very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,   > but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I   > do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while   > we are traveling.  So, instead of focusing on your selection,   > you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe   > because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not   > selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress   > the benefits, not the features. >>  >> 11) Keep the reader interested.  Some sales letters read   > like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can   > perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are   > filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to   > understand.  Unless you are writing to a very targeted   > audience, avoid using technical language that many readers   > might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language   > and information that are easy to understand and follow. >>  >> 12) Target your sales letter.  When you are finished with   > your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a   > specific audience.  For example: If you are selling a 'work   > at home' product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding   > words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards   > women who are homemakers.  Then, rewrite the same sales   > letter and target it to college students.  Write another   > letter targeting senior citizens.  Still another could be   > written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income   > during summer vacation.  The possibilities are endless. >>  >> All you need to do is add a few words here and there in   > your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service   > is specifically designed for a target audience. 'Work only   > 5 hours a week,' would become 'College Students, work only   > 5 hours a week.'  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload   > all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website   > (you could easily target 100's of groups). >>  >> Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted   > mediums.  You could advertise the 'College Students' page   > in a campus ezine.  The 'Senior Citizens' page could be   > advertised at a retirement community message board. >>  >> By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally   > open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product   > to.  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a   > match made for them. >>  >> 13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.  Use short sentences   > and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention   > grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One   > thing that I have always found to work very well in sales   > letters... >>  >>      ...is to use a pause like this.  >>  >> Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting   > to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,   > if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on   > several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook   > line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. 'Let's   > get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK   > HERE to continue.' >>  >> 14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.  When the   > customer purchases your product, they will generate 'a flood   > of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.'   > If they do not order today, then they will 'feel like a cat   > that let the mouse get away.'  Use words to create a picture   > in the readers' mind.  When you think of Superman, what   > comes to mind?  Immediately, we remember that he is 'faster   > than a speeding bullet.'  'More powerful than a locomotive.'   > 'Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.' See how   > word pictures stick in our minds? >>  >> 15) Focus on one product or service.  Don't try to sell   > your customer multiple products at the same time. It only   > confuses the reader.  Keep your ad copy directed at one   > specific product or service.  Then, use other products and   > services as back-end products. >>  >> 16) Make it stand out.  Don't kid yourself.  There are   > hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the   > same thing you are doing.  How will you stand out among the   > crowd?  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must   > breathe of originality.  Your product or service is   > different. It's not like all of the rest.  It is unique.   > Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the   > competition.  It must create a feeling of 'You won't find   > this anywhere else.' >>  >> 17) Be believable. 'Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!'   > Delete.  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or   > something?  Get real.  Don't make outrageous claims that   > are obviously not the truth.  You'll ruin your reputation.   > Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be   > reversed.  Once you have been branded a liar, you will   > NEVER be anything but a liar.  It doesn't matter if you   > launch the most respectable, honest business available   > anywhere, people will always have doubt because they   > remember the crazy stuff you've said before.  Be believable.   > Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth. >>  >> 18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but   > rather be EXACT.  Instead of 'over 100 tips for losing   > weight' use '124 tips for losing weight.' By generalizing   > information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's   > mind.  'What am I really getting here?  Does he even know?'   > When you use specific information, the reader begins to   > think, 'This person must have counted.  I know exactly what   > I can expect.'  'Platitudes and generalities roll off the   > human understanding like water from a duck,' wrote Claude   > Hopkins in his classic book 'Scientific Advertising.' 'They   > leave no impression whatsoever.' >>  >> 19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would   > want to know about your product or service.  Answer all of   > their questions, anything they would want to consider before   > making a purchase.  Think about it from their point of view.   > Ask yourself, 'Why wouldn't I buy this?'  Then, address that   > in your sales letter.  Remove anything that would keep the   > reader from making the purchase. >>  >> 20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.  Share actual   > excerpts from what your current customers are saying about   > your product or service. Many websites have an entire   > section or even a separate page that has endorsements and   > compliments listed.  Satisfied customers remove some of the   > doubt in the mind of the reader.  'If these people have   > found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I   > probably will too.'  Especially effective are testimonials   > from respected, well known 'authorities' within your target   > field. >>  >> 21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.   > A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your   > ad copy.  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.  A well-   > placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings   > them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next   > paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on   > your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.  They are   > that important. >>  >> 22) Avoid asking stupid questions.  'Wouldn't you like to   > make $1,000,000 a year?' 'Doesn't that sound great?' 'Would   > you like to be as successful as I am?'  Avoid any question   > that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them   > feel like they are inferior. >>  >> 23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.   > If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a   > purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try   > to influence them to buy in the future.  By offering a free   > item, you can  request their email address in order to   > obtain the freebie.  By doing this, you can now follow-up   > with the customer for a potential future sale.   > Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having   > your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.   > And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful   > product or service which impresses the customer, they   > probably will be back as a customer soon. >>  >> 24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.  One of the things   > that I have found very effective in writing sales letters   > is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product   > I am offering.  Ginsu made this one famous. They were   > selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial   > was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table   > it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality   > bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages   > the credibility of your main offer. >>  >> 25) Use connective phrases like 'But wait, there's more'   > and 'But that's not all.'  These phrases effectively lead   > the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly   > when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or   > leads into bonus items.  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE   > value and benefits to the reader. >>  >> 26) Always include a deadline.  By including a deadline,   > you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.   > 'If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the   > bonuses.'  'Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,   > I've got to hurry.'  Let the customer know what they will   > be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,   > they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will   > miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines   > are very effective.  Every sales letter should have one. >>  >> 27) Tell them exactly how to order.  Be clear as to the   > order process. Point them towards the order link.  Tell   > them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,   > etc.)  Make this process as simple and clear as can be.   > If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue. >>  >> 28)  Explain when the product will be delivered.  How   > quickly will the order be processed?  When will the order be   > available?  Let the customer know exactly what they can   > expect when they place their order.  The more specific you   > can be here, the better.  Let them know that you have a   > system in place.  'Operators are standing by.'  Their order   > will be handled properly.  Tell them. >>  >> 29) Offer a money back guarantee.  Take away their last   > reason to hold back.  Offer a 'no questions asked' 30 day   > guarantee.  Most people may not realize this, but in most   > cases, it's the law of the land.  You are REQUIRED to give   > them their money back if they are not satisfied with the   > product or service.  Since it's the law anyway, why not make   > it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your   > product or service RISK-FREE. >>  >> 30) Instruct them to respond immediately.  Many people   > just need to read those words, 'Act Now!'  'Order today!'   > 'Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.'  You've got them   > this far, now tell them what you want them to do.  Get them   > to 'Act Fast!'  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial   > on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right   > way? >>  >> 31) Include a post script.  People will always read the   > P.S.  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT   > parts of your sales letter. Why?  Because in many cases the   > visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the   > end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.  A   > P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they   > see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed   > description of what they will receive for their money. Use   > your P.S. to restate your offer in detail. >>  >> 32) Include a second post script.  You better believe   > if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.  Use   > this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer   > another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would   > make them want to order.  I guarantee you they will read it. >>  >> Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see   > a significant increase in the amount of responses you   > receive from your sales letters.  In fact, it would be   > impossible for your responses to not improve.   >   >>  >> Copyright 2000 Jimmy D. Brown.

"Subject: why i love unverifiable voting machines , by the prez . how i stole your election by george w . bush the first thing i did to steal your election was to make friends with all the manufacturers and code - verifyers of the electronic voting machines . they were really nice , especially diebold who gave me $ 600 , 000 for my campaign . wow , thanks dude ! next , i had my attack dog , karl rove , convince these companies to either alter the vote totals on the central tabulator machines ( simple pcs running windows using remote access server - - ras ) , or reprogram ( via a downloadable software patch ) the voting machines themselves so that they would give the advantage to me ! isn ' t america great ? ! ? a little money and some religious zealotry goes a looooong , loooong way . oh , the religious zealotry thing ? that ' s just a cover . i ' m not really a christian - - or at least i don ' t act like one . anyway , i digress . did you ever hear the media complaining about how inaccurate the exit polls were in prior elections ? no . that ' s because they basically are accurate . but this election , the exit polls showed kerry way ahead . no problem . my buddies rigged the machines ( and all they needed to do was rig it in one state , ohio , but they took care of at least florida for me too ) not only to make me squeak by in the important battleground states , like florida and ohio , but they also made sure that when i did get a state that i was expected to win , the margin was huge so that my popular vote would make it look like i had a mandate . so let ' s recap how the popular vote thing worked again . let ' s say we didn ' t want it to look suspicious by taking states that kerry really would have won ( except for ohio and florida , gotta take those ! heh heh ) . so we let him win there , but in order once again to boost the popular vote ( i put that in quotes because as you know , i ' m not really popular ) , we bring my vote tallies right up next to kerry ' s , to jack up the popular vote as much as possible , even if i didn ' t win the state . then , with states like north carolina , we know we ' re going to steal the state anyway ( at least according to what the exit polls were telling everyone . . . . and according to the long , long lines of new voters were telling everyone . . . because we all know most of those people were voting for kerry , not the status quo ) , so we just jack the crap out of the vote total to really stuff a crapload of popular votes in my pocket . you see , this way i can get on the tv and declare that i have a mandate and that i ' m going to cash in on my political capital ( which i don ' t really have of course , but we made it look that way ) . here ' s a nice chart to show you what i mean . take special note of how the electronic voting machine totals compare to the paper ballot totals . and see what i mean about north carolina ? look folks , if you really want me out of office , first you ' re going to have to impeach me . but you know what , if you don ' t have verifiable paper trails at the polls like these folks recommend ( http : / / . org / ) , and if you don ' t take these voting machines out of the hands of private companies that are aligned with one end of the political spectrum , then i ' m gonna just continue to hose you ( and then my brother jeb will be president too cause we ' re into this dynasty thing , kind of like my buddies the saudis . . . ain ' t it cool ? ! ? ) . also , in 2006 , we ' re going to steal about five more senate seats , and then we ' ll have the super - majority . that means the democrats can ' t do that confounded fillerbs . . . fillas . . . . fillbusters . . . . crap , well , they can ' t get in the darn way any more and we can pass any laws we want about anything and put whoever we want on the supreme court . ha ha , then you ' re really screwed . so if you don ' t fix this mess ( i mean great system ) in two years and have a verifiable voting system nationwide , america is mine ! ! ! ! ! ( and jeb ' s and my daddy ' s and cheney ' s and rove ' s . . . hey , we could even pass a law saying i could be president for four more years after 2008 ! that would be sooo cool ! ) anyway , i digress once again . and that pesky bev harris . man i wish she would go away . if too many of you contribute to her cause , i might just get in trouble so knock it off ! ! http : / / www . blackboxvoting . org / i ' ve said it before and i ' ll say it again , fool me once . . . . . , oh crap , i forgot again . well how about this ? this would be a heck of lot easier if this was [ grammar incorrect ] a dictatorship . . . . just so long as i ' m the dictator . heh , heh . well , sorry to say folks , but i got my way . what are you gonna do about it , huh ? bring it on ! ! ! sincerely yours , president george w . bush p . s . pass it on ! i dare ya .

"Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing?? right Mike, i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart. my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing). i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting. my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see amongst each other. that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice. just that it is fundamental. from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes things 'big time'. rgds, rob \-----Original Message----- From: Mike Masnick [mailto:mike@techdirt.com] Sent: Tuesday, August 20, 2002 11:58 PM To: Rob Shavell Cc: fork@spamassassin.taint.org Subject: RE: sprint delivers the next big thing??

This does nothing to answer my question. I *do* care about content. Hell, if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day, I'd have a different opinion of this. I just am not convinced that they will (stupid or not). While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who communicate by pictures? Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something? I don't buy it. For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism. For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not nearly as often as words. Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and such are games? Because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across. >misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same >thing about '1 hour photo' processing. trivial, who needs it, i get better >resultion elswhere. and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant >had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera, >and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of >decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the >photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way. also, SMS >didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less. its >greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS >traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth. in reality, >SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle. Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with 'you just don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this'). I wasn't saying that MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't easy. I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way that 'changed the face of communications'. I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why people would want to do this. Sure, if they integrate cameras into the phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people. But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or offline) photoalbum. I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial. People want to see their own pics right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots. That's one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on. The instant view part. I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want 'instant view', but also 'instant show'. Which is what this service offers. I'm not convinced that most people want 'instant show'. I think people like to package their pictures and show them. That's why people put together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture. Sure, occasionally 'instant show' is nice, but it's just 'nice' on occasion. I still can't see how it becomes a integral messaging method. What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another? There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's silly if people are going to flock to it. I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet. The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately are Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of what happened - before the press even gets there. Willing to be proven wrong, Mike PS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork  "

"Subject: [zzzzteana] Moscow bomber Man Threatens Explosion In Moscow           Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM     MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who     said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in     front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV     television reported.     The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man     got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details     were immediately available.     The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and     ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to     talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.     Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within     blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the     man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news     agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside     the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.     The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove     to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held     further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The     move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more     secure location.           ------------------------ Yahoo!

My legs should be arriving in Moscow any time now. All my feathers have been processed and are now being eaten by cattle somewhere in Texas.

Buckminster Fuller I had cited the information theoretic concept of 'elegance' in my dissertation & did a Google to find the reference and instead found a really great tech report for UoT Knoxville by Bruce MacLennan. He cites Efficiency, Economy, and Elegance, but I think he's wrong. The middle E should be Effectiveness. Otherwise kudos.

MacLennan Computer Science Department University of Tennessee, Knoxville MacLennan@cs.utk.edu Abstract The crucial role played by aesthetics in programming language design and the importance of elegance in programming languages are defended on the basis of analogies with structural engineering, as presented in Billington's The Tower and the Bridge. This report may be used for any nonprofit purpose provided that its source is acknowledged. It will be adapted for inclusion in the third edition of my Principles of Programming Languages. 1.The Value of Analogies 2.Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used 3.Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost 4.Elegance Symbolizes Good Design 1.For the Designer 2.For the User 5.The Programming Language as Work Environment 6.Acquiring a Sense of Elegance 7.References The Value of Analogies Programming language design is a comparatively new activity - it has existed for less than half a century, so it is often worthwhile to look to older design disciplines to understand better this new activity. Thus, my book Principles of Programming Languages: Design, Evaluation, and Implementation, grew out of a study of teaching methods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design. Perhaps you have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN = Model T, C = dune buggy, etc.). These analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps'' to enhance our creativity, but they cannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must be based on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative. In this essay I'll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarks on a book about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are many differences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer rather directly. According to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call ``the three E's'': Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology, which Billington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S's). We will consider each in turn. Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used In structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety and the issues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming language design, efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where efficiency considerations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming Languages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing time, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was programmer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN's implicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed for the sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking). Efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we are not comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as programmer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are reduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now turn. Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost Whereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seeks to maximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges are usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public'' that must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these programmers work. Economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example, the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost of computer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the increasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of program maintenance compared to program development. Other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major manufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some way by influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whether it comes to be perceived as a ``real'' language (used by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy'' language (used by novices or dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors are frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming language. Often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are often unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, from dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately represented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost'' and ``benefit'' must be considered in seeking an economical design. Elegance Symbolizes Good Design ``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly the critical role of elegance in ``hard-nosed'' engineering. For the Designer It is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the difficulty of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples). Structural engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don't make extensive use of computer models and calculation. One reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which variables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this decision is not made well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this is another potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical analysis may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of safety is additional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy). Similarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a choice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an over- engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical. Many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design. Billington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a consequence of an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyed the Tacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided by aesthetic principles. According to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do not abandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because solutions to structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible solutions to a particular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attention to designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are unbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable. The general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can be guided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea by inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds (p. 21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' In other words, the choice of form is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and economical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design. The same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the interaction of features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having to check all the possible interactions. For the User In this case, what's good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge that looks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which features may ``explode'' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well- designed bridge gives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should reinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the consequences of our actions. We accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to sustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won't much matter that it was beautiful on the outside. So also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation of a deep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their (unwarranted) confidence. In summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a consequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or programming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages: The Elegance Principle Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good. The Programming Language as Work Environment There are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming language is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable and safe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that take place within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop? A programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer's fatigue and frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator, encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines'' and work as a natural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine'' by encouraging the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming language should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs. Through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety of its features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may represent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming language can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by neglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention. Out of sight, out of mind. Acquiring a Sense of Elegance Aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined sense of elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive experience in design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers. Because of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public also critiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along with that of the designers. So also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively - and criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people's designs and try to improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing'' comes along.

"Subject: Native American economics (was Re: sed /s/United States/Roman     Empire/g) I wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time. I actually lived on a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well. And my parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than I have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents). I do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand from my father. The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income. While it is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not something that was impressed upon them. The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals, typically an 'Indian Corporation' of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe). In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per person, depending on the tribe. The dividend money comes from a number of places, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and various businesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation. You have to understand a couple things: First, a great many Indian tribes are run as purely communist enterprises. Everyone gets a check for their share no matter what. One of the biggest problems this has caused is very high unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy take their dividend and not work. The dividend they receive from the corporation often constitutes their sole 'income' for government accounting purposes. Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one works, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those dividends. Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works. One of the ironies is that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn, many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white folk, not Indians. Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually. By benefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government. It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are ineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are very smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good credentials to run their business divisions. An example of this is the Haida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have gross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing). Yet the dividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular case, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to intelligent investment and use. They don't eat their seed corn, and have actually managed to grow their stash. In contrast, a couple islands over, there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50 million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets. This particular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many borrow money against future income. Incidentally, in this particular case, the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand dollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather than their own pockets. Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable assets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously given where feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign companies. And the cycle continues. So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems? In a nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society. Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant. Incest, rape, and gross promiscuity is rampant. Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded. Many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above. On one reservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%. Many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police etc). In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I have ever seen anywhere. Because of their legal status, there really aren't that many consequences for their behavior. There are many things that I could tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unless you'd seen it yourself. There are always good people in these tribes, but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically. (BTW, if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations. It will give you an interesting perspective on things.) There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous Indians. The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely. The second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if they maintain their tribal identity. In both of these cases, the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above. The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita. And the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole. It is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income. The poverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic. This was my original point. On a tangent: One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal corporate socialism. Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate socialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution. That they use this structure at all is an accident of history more than anything. But what has interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well over the long run. It is like a Family Corporation writ large. It seems that in a future where 'familial' ties will be increasingly voluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western society, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with the included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self- selecting individuals. Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com On 9/22/02 3:53 PM, 'John Hall'  wrote: > > As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans > who speak english at home and those who do not.

"Subject: San Francisco caffeine tour URL: http://boingboing.net/#85481649 Date: Not supplied Javawalk is a coffee- oriented walking-tour of San Francisco. Javawalk is a two-hour walk in the city center. We start at Union Square and wind through Chinatown, Jackson Square and North Beach, the city's Italian district. While we cover the city's coffee roots (much more significant than Seattle's!) and coffeehouse culture (think beatnik), we also spend some time on San Francisco's history, interesting and arcane trivia and stories the Javagirl has collected from many years of living in the city. Truly, some things could only happen in SF! Javawalk also makes a couple of stops at North Beach cafes for a quick java jolt. Since cool weather prevails here, we need coffee year-round in the city by the Bay. Lucky us!

"Subject: Cash Flow Doesn't Lie...Even After Today's Rally  You are receiving this email because you signed up to receive one of our free reports. If you would prefer not to receive messages of this type, please unsubscribe by following the instructions at the bottom of this message. Dear Fool, Just before Enron plunged... ...16 of 17 Wall Street analysts were still urging you to buy Enron's stock. While the company piled up debt and manufactured imaginary earnings, auditors gave the balance sheet a big thumbs- up. As investors lost everything, Enron insiders pocketed millions. AND THAT should make every investor's blood boil! Frankly, the Enrons and Global Crossings of the world infuriate me. All the backroom manipulations dirty dealing and cover-ups really make it hard to know who you can trust. And that is why we've created a NEW investing service, 'David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool Stock Advisor' -- to bring the Motley Fool co-founders' extraordinary commitment to honest stock analysis, fair dealing and complete disclosure to investors like you on a regular and timely basis. The Motley Fool, which David and Tom founded back in 1993, is dedicated to the principle that given the right tools...the average guy can find great success in every aspect of his financial life. And now, David and Tom are applying this principle -- and their extensive investing experience -- to the new 'Motley Fool Stock Advisor.' But as you'll see, this service isn't just about 'buying more stocks.' OUR GOAL in publishing the 'Motley Fool Stock Advisor' is twofold: To help you gain the knowledge, confidence and resolve to make money in the U.S. stock market...while avoiding the biggest mistakes, as well. The Wall Street analysts touting Global Crossing said its worldwide fiber-optics network would make it the king of telecom. Now these shares are WORTH NOTHING. Microstrategy was the poster child of the technology bubble-after earnings restatements, the stock now sits 99% OFF its high! Kmart's lousy inventory management and marketing incompetence helped drive the company into BANKRUPTCY. WHAT ABOUT Nortel and Lucent-two of America's most widely owned stocks. Will they ever come back? How about AOL? Does its merger with Time-Warner mean the GLORY DAYS are over -- or have they just begun? Are 90% of all telecommunications companies truly in danger of disappearing? If so, which will survive? Will great old names like JP Morgan, Disney and Motorola recover? Well, those are the sorts of questions David & Tom Gardner can help you answer at the 'Motley Fool Stock Advisor.' As they say, 'Show us the money.' When it comes to making promises, fast-talkers can fudge just about anything. But CASH FLOW doesn't lie. YOU CAN avoid a lot of big mistakes by simply making sure a company has the cash coming in to pay its bills. And watching cash flow is also one of the best ways to identify superstar companies -- far more reliable than 'earnings' that can be manipulated 8 ways to Sunday. Once you eliminate big losers from the equation -- and target the true superstars -- you'll find investing more fun...less stressful...and much more profitable, as well. So forget about Wall Street's 'damaged goods'- companies that have a boatload of debt and accounting woes, as well. Keep it SIMPLE instead. 'Simple' means investing in companies that we all -- with a little effort -- can understand. Companies where we know what businesses they're really in. Companies where the financial statements actually mean something. And companies easily recognizable as the 'best of breed.' In the free report you received, 'The One Stock That Keeps Wall Street BUZZING,' you read about one of David & Tom's very favorite investments: Starbucks. Before this company came along, most folks just took coffee for granted. And certainly, no one proposed any far-reaching business model built around it. Yet these innovators took a low-margin commodity and built a near $3 BILLION company with more than 5000 retail outfits all around the world. Starbucks has been able to open new outlets based on money it has earned from existing ones. That is an astounding testament to its economic power. At The Motley Fool Stock Advisor we'll help you find and truly understand the great investments, the companies with solid balance sheets and real growth prospects. Right now we're following companies such as: *America's most prestigious jeweler -- its brand name has no rival. With net margins of 59% on sales of $1.6 Billion, this company is a great pick for solid returns with low risk. *This software company commands more than 25% of the video game market. Its shares have returned 6,000% since its public debut in 1989. An investment of $5,000 in 1989 is now worth over $300,000. The video game market is expected to double by 2005 with this company enjoying the lion's share of the growth. *This premier credit rating company has locked-in demand for its reports on the creditworthiness of borrowers holding $30 trillion of the world's debt. It has a 20-year record of consistent sales and income growth and is poised for another stellar year. YOU CAN TRY the 'Motley Fool Stock Advisor' for six full months 100% RISK-FREE. If we don't prove its worth to you, it doesn't cost you a dime. As a Charter Subscriber, you get the 'Motley Fool Stock Advisor' delivered to your home each month; a monthly, between- issue, e-mail Fool Flash to help you take full advantage of breaking news; full use of the Motley Fool Stock Advisor subscriber-only Web site, featuring current & back newsletter issues...full updates on all selected stocks...Q & A...and more; plus introductory Special Reports exclusively for new subscribers.

Do you like BIG PROFITS? In 1994, investment pros sniffed at America Online's high-flying stock and screamed, 'Overvalued.' But the Gardners saw three things they overlooked: 1) AOL was building the premier stop in cyberspace; 2) They had a great retention strategy; and 3) Millions of members paying $$$ every month. So Tom and David bought it. And today they're sitting on whopping 4,120% gains. So you see, while they do structure their investing strategy to avoid big blunders...they do make a lot of money, too.

"Subject: Kevin Mitnick's laptop, signed by Woz, on eBay URL: http://boingboing.net/#85513208      Date: Not supplied          Kevin 'Free Kevin' Mitnick and Steve 'Woz' Wozniak co-hosted an episode of The      Screen Saver on Tech TV, where Woz autographed one of the laptops that Kevin      got arrested for using. Now that machine, signed by both net-celebs, is up for      sale on eBay.               This is the Toshiba Satellite T1960CS, 486 laptop computer seized by the          FBI on February 15, 1995, in Raleigh, NC, during the arrest of the world's          most celebrated computer hacker, Kevin Mitnick. The laptop is working and          has been loaded with a fresh version of Windows 95. A shrink-wrapped          version of Windows 95 on floppy, is included with the laptop. The laptop is          a 486DX with a color LCD, detachable trackball mouse, AT&T; 14.4 PCMCIA          modem card, power adapter and documentation in FBI evidence bags. The          laptop has been signed on the bottom by Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple          Computer, and says, 'You've got the whole world in your hands. --Woz (Free          Kevin!). It is also signed by Mitnick himself.

Ananova: Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists' Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause. Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, 'to keep the pro-hunt thing in the papers'. Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider. In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s. But no-one reported anything to the police. A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but he had seen 'a red blob' on the horse and had sent officers to investigate. In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any complaints. Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

"Subject: otc gdvi - the momentum continues - gdvi website debute otc bbalert gdvi news update : global diversified industries debutes brand new website ! www . gdvi . net otc bb alert spectacular operating results momentum continues sales projections for next 12 months surpasses $ 20 million 99 . 8 % revenue increase 278 % net income increase 154 % stockholders equity increase 79 % increase in assets $ 8 million order backlog $ 50 million manufacturing capacity overview global diversified industries operates in the modular building construction industry , and strategically targets the california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in central california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot state - of - the - art manufacturing facility . throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth . through the combination of its new facility ( $ 50 million capacity ) , the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california ' s bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast . gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies . global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 , including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in 2005 . the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per annum businesses . in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition candidates through its aggressive growth plan . profile gdvi is a holding company that currently operates two wholly owned subsidiaries , mbs construction inc . , a modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and global modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures . its principal customer base is currently educational ( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care and municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs , including both single - story and two - story floor plans . global modular ' s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre - approved building plans , commonly referred to as p . c . ' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) . global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause . the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district . this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids . a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years , depending on the term of the piggyback contract . the strategic focus on california schools since 1998 , california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures . there are five compelling reasons for this trend : modular classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks ) they cost significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 ) they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth , the state department of education estimates that california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms . due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector , public and private schools are expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years . the california schools budget crisis on november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by california voters . this bond measure passage does not include an approximate $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state . a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the voters on the march 2004 . these bond measures are about three times higher than the record $ 9 . 2 billion bond california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations . money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other institutions of higher learning throughout california . gdvi business infrastructure among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated , state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular structures . gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking to add to its workforce as demand increases . operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square foot operating structure . wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets , designs and manufactures the buildings wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles installation and building renovation . symbol otc . bb gdvi recent price 13 . 5 cents management team philip hamilton , ceo and president mr . hamilton has an extensive and very successful background in modular manufacturing . from 1996 to feb 2000 he served as chairman and ceo of pacesetter industries inc . he built this company from inception into one of californias largest manufacturers , producing and installing thousands of schools and commercial buildings . under his leadership , pacesetter industries moved into a 5 , 500 , 000 sq . ft . facility in atwater , california with branch sales offices throughout the state . the company employed a staff of over 650 employees and had annual sales of $ 50 , 000 , 000 . adam de bard , vice president mr . de bard has over 6 years of experience in the manufacturing and business sectors . from 1997 to 2000 he served as vice president and chief information officer of pacesetter industries . ronald kilpatrick , director of finance mr . kilpatrick has 36 years experience in both domestic and international development and management of major corporations . he is a managing partner of pacific rim capital llc which provides venture capital to projects in the pacific rim . recent headlines global diversified industries , inc . commencing efforts to increase its u . s . based investor and public relations visibility pr newswire ( tue 5 : 00 am ) global diversified industries , inc . modular division secures new order worth more than $ 3 million for immediate delivery pr newswire ( thu , jun 9 ) wallst . net airing all - new , exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and geoi pr newswire ( tue , jun 7 ) wallst . net airing exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and xle pr newswire ( thu , jun 2 ) global diversified industries , inc . acquires valuable assets from california modular company pr newswire ( thu , may 26 ) global diversified industries , inc . modular division implementing its fourth production line pr newswire ( thu , may 19 ) talkingstocks . com announces interview with philip hamilton , president and ceo of global diversified industries , inc . primezone media network ( tue , may 17 ) stockguru . com initiates profile coverage of global diversified industries , inc . primezone media network ( mon , may 16 ) global diversified industries ' modular division billings total $ 1 . 4 million in april ;

"Subject: Selling Travel in Today's Economy                                                Good morning!                                                                           Since it may have been awhile since you visited us     at www.mailpound.com I       wanted to update you on what is happening. When we launched the MailPound       almost two years ago, our focus was on saving 'Time, Toner and       Trees' by providing an alternative for organizing the huge       number of faxes suppliers sent travel agents each week. Our most popular       feature was the FAM section, followed by the Weekly Sweepstakes.                                                                           But that has changed.                                                                           Like many involved in selling retail travel, we have been       striving to find ways to succeed in a challenging environment. Additional       commission cuts, the aftermath of 9/11, and the drop in the stock     market, has       had a cumulative effect on all of us. To survive, to succeed, we know     that we       will need to work harder, work smarter, and work together. We have     gotten a       tremendous amount of support from travel agents and this has translated     into       the ability to get more support for travel agents from suppliers.                                                                           Our focus has expanded from providing a resource for     searching supplier       Special Offers to providing a suite of tools and services that can create       sales and raise commissions. Almost all of these services are supplier       supported and FREE to travel agents.                                            * Actively seek out the best e-commerce     values              * Help you market Special Offers to your     clients              * Host personal web sites for travel agents with     MailPound         content*              * Offer higher commissions through     consolidation              * Organize sales incentives from suppliers              * Provide new technology for fast and easy online         bookings              * Provide your clients with the ability to book through     you,         online                                     * MPdirect services are offered for     $9.95/month                                                                           We invite you to visit us soon at www.mailpound.com or       check out the links shown below.

"Subject: a basic idea of price - offer matching clauses vince - here is the basic idea i was alluding to : suppose a car dealer promised to ' match any advertised price . ' then his competitor would feel the need to respond in kind . and so on , until all dealers advertised they would ' match any advertised price . ' now , consider one of these dealer ' s decision to perhaps lower his prices . if he does so , everyone will immediately match his price , so his market share will remain unchanged , at whatever it was before , but his revenues ( and all other dealers as well ) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction . so , the dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars . now , suppose a limited partnership , where the partners contract to ' control ' who they are in business with , by putting a ' right of first refusal ' clause into the partnership ' s papers , whereby any partner wishing to sell his interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the partner received from outside for his shares . now , suppose you are an outsider , considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want to buy into the partnership . you know if your offer is a ' good ' one from your perspective , offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return , the existing partners will match it , and you will get nothing in the deal but you will have paid , from your own pocket , for your due diligence . conversely , if you offer too much for the shares , then the other partners will not match your offer and you will then realize you overpaid . in neither case can you credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current partners . so , you ( basically ) don ' t make an offer . so , a partner ' s shares are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers he receives for them . the ' right of first refusal ' clause precludes economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares ( essentially ) illiquid . clayton"

Point the first, I doubt if they are trying to change Rumsy's mind but rather to show others that there is a vocal and violent opposition to his views. With such flagrant showings of opposition there would be more coverage of the opposing ideas and thus the spreading of the dissenting meme. A viri need not comply with the wishes of the attacked host, rather the host had better make some antibodies or learn to adapt. Point the second. Historicaly the 'in yer face' mode of confrontation has been used to gain popular support and to grow from seeds 'grass roots' movements. Witness the big bold 'in yer face' signature of Hancock on the 'in yer face' Declaration of the american colonies to the governing powers of england. Witness also the chicago seven, Others will follow in examplare form upon digging. Now point the third, is it annoying? Yes, and if your annoyed then the 'in yer facers' have done thier job. Sad to say the polite persnikiters are teh very fule the 'in yer facers' hope to ignite. If your burning, your being used. Pointed the personal...The politics of the polite are more often the refuge of backstabings, closed mouth recourlessness and hypocritcal behavoirs.

"Subject: Validation URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85395270 Date: Not supplied I feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. Mozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me (or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1]. I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0: _Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._ Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing wrong, and they don't listen. Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, stupid, incompetent buffoons? 'I told you so.' never felt so good. Maybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about fucking time. And people wonder why I quit working for AOL.

"Subject: Kissinger      [can't think of how I'd be running     afoul of the spam filters with this     post, so here's the second try...]          Kissinger's book _Does America Need     a Foreign Policy?_ provides a few     handy abstractions:          > The ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between     > values ['idealism'] and interests ['realism'] and, occasionally,     > between peace and justice.          Also, he views historical American     approaches to foreign policy as a     bundle of three fibers:          Hamiltonian - We should only get       involved in foreign adventures       to preserve balances of power.          Wilsonian - We should only get       involved in foreign adventures       to further democracy, etc.          Jacksonian - We should never get       involved in foreign adventures.       Unless we're attacked.  Then we       go Rambo.          He has tactfully left out the hard     realists*; as for the rest I gather     wilsonians play the idealists, and     hamiltonians act where values and     interests intersect, and jacksonians      act only when values and interests     overlap.          Kissinger himself seems to be a     Hamiltonian; much of the book is     about how he thinks we ought to     be shaping the balance of power     in various foreign regions.          Maybe I've been too affected by     Kant, but I can't see that such     a strategy works unless one can     count on a Bismarck runnning it:     how lopsided does the US look if     everyone tries to run a balance     of power politics?          - -Dave          *     > The road to empire leads to domestic decay because, in time, the claims     > of omnipotence erode domestic restraints.  No empire has avoided the     > road to Caesarism unless, like the British Empire, it devolved its     > power before this process could develop.  In long-lasting empires,     > every problem turns into a domestic issue [which should be handled     > very differently from international ones] because the outside world     > no longer provides a counterweight.  And as challenges grow more     > diffuse and increasingly remote from the historic domestic base,     > internal struggles become ever more bitter and in time violent.     > A deliberate quest for hegemony is the surest way to destroy the     > values that made the United States great.          Kings and tyrants generically have     followed the same power politics:     garner popular support by keeping     potential oligarchs down.  In other     traditions, a king is a legitimate     tyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate     king.  In the US, I'd hope that we,     like Samuel, wouldn't naturally make     such fine distinctions.                 "

"Subject: Turkey City Lexicon URL: http://boingboing.net/#85506002      Date: Not supplied          After the talk at UT Austin, I spent Saturday at the Turkey City science      fiction writers' workshop at Bruce Sterling's place. Turkey City is a venerable      science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of      science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding      what works and what doesn't in a work of science fiction:               Squid on the Mantelpiece               Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the          first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot          element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic          emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming          that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It's hard to          properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad's bank overdraft when          a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the          conventional dramatic proprieties and SF's extreme, grotesque, or visionary          thematics is known as the 'squid on the mantelpiece.'               Card Tricks in the Dark               Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private          joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia          relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and          very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose.          (Attr. Tim Powers)           I had the cold from hell all weekend and I'm jetlagged, but I wanted to get      some links up before I hit the sack. Until tomorrow!

"Subject: MY PLEA FOR ASSISTANCE PLEASE MR. AYANDA MAREDI DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA. Good morning, It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues. I venture to write to you perhaps you will see it fit to assist my colleagues and I in all honesty as we attempt to seek your assistance. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it confidential because of the nature of this business. Within the Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as a Director of Audit and Project implementation, with the co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$29,200,000.00 (Twenty-Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed. Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to front as the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of You/your Company. I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be US$7.3m (25%) while my colleagues and I receive US$18.98m (65%) and the balance of US$2.92m (10%) for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred. This business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does notmatter whether You/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour of You/your Company. Also, your specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us. Kindly notify me by telephone on 27-83-750 9598 or fax 27-73-219 9975 for further details upon your acceptance of this proposal. May God's blessings be with you even as you reply. Regards, MR.

As the legislative season ends, it is vitally important to gather support for legislation that will be center-stage in the next session. This is an opportunity to ask your representative to take a stand for your rights. Ask her/him to co-sponsor the DMCRA today! Representatives Rick Boucher and John Doolittle recently introduced the Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act (DMCRA, H.R. 5544), which would require labelling on usage-impaired 'copy-protected' compact discs and would make several several amendments to 1998's infamous Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

For membership information see: http://www.eff.org/support/ -=end=----------------------------------------------------------- * ALERT: Bait and Switch; Anticounterfeiting Bill Hurts Your Rights! Don't be fooled by Senator Biden's 'Anticounterfeiting Amendments of 2002' (S. 2395, also known as 'the Biden Bill'). It started as an attempt to stop organized crime from forging holograms and counterfeiting money, but its scope has been greatly expanded to include digital watermarks on copyrighted material. This is a sneaky power-grab that would greatly diminish the rights of the public in copyrighted works while expanding the power of copyright owners. It goes well beyond the scope of current copyright law and could: ~ Prevent universities, libraries, and consumers from enjoying the exceptions to the Copyright Act adopted by Congress. S. 2935 could prohibit the use of interface information essential for software interoperability and competition ~ Impose new responsibilities on Internet service providers and could also require consumer electronics and computer manufacturers to reconfigure their products. ~ Impose more severe criminal and civil penalties than permitted by the Copyright Act for identical behavior This 'anticounterfeiting' bill is a decoy; stand up for your rights today! Subscribe to the EFF Action Center and send your member of Congress an email, letter or fax. You can take action by going to: http://action.eff.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item;=2274 Join EFF! For membership information see: http://www.eff.org/support/ -=end=----------------------------------------------------------- * Canadian Trademark Law Overreaching EFF has been involved in several cases involving overreaching trademark claims on the Internet. Recently we have learned about a Canadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal information website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem especially egregious. Lawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been published since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued by Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group. Quicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name LAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website under that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of the Quicklaw.com website that offers public 'teasers' in the form of summaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available through the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian lawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially different, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed computer service and the other for information freely available on the public internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more problematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the term LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed requests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark authorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a Canadian trademark issued for 'lawsnet.' Regardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia through over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a court order requiring her to undergo an extensive 'discovery' process that threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free legal assistance in the past, this next phase will require significantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can muster. Quicklaw is represented by a large Toronto firm, Borden Ladner and Gervais, LLP. Abuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even been granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is unfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw, and its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and useful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark is causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant ownership in words, especially descriptive words like 'laws' and 'net' when describing an online legal information service. Trademark law should also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal information (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop individuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free legal information to the public. For those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local Toronto lawyer and part-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a legal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help, please contact: Mr. Gil Lan Barrister & Solicitor 393 University Avenue Suite 2000 Toronto, Ontario, M5G 1E6 or by email at: glan@globalbusinesslaw.com or Ling Xia at: editor@lawsnet.com -=end=----------------------------------------------------------- * Give Twice as Many Gifts this Holiday Season!

"Subject: NYTimes.com Article: Why We're So Nice: We're Wired to Cooperate This article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu. Axelrod, eh? 'the E.coli of social psychology'? Nice to see our old friend still going strong -- Prisoner's Dilemma is old enough to qualify for AARP membership! Regarding experimental design, it is interesting that 1) they used an all-female panel and 2) they included a mix of ages, from 20-60 and 3) they used humans, confederates, computers as well as imitations. The last two paragraphs are a rare sign of editorialized humor by an NY Times bylined writer. Even still, note the very large fig leaf -- the CEO joke is introduced in an on-the-record quote. Not that we're talking about anything nearly as colorful as the Economist :-) RK khare@alumni.caltech.edu Why We're So Nice: We're Wired to Cooperate July 23, 2002 By NATALIE ANGIER What feels as good as chocolate on the tongue or money in the bank but won't make you fat or risk a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission? Hard as it may be to believe in these days of infectious greed and sabers unsheathed, scientists have discovered that the small, brave act of cooperating with another person, of choosing trust over cynicism, generosity over selfishness, makes the brain light up with quiet joy. Studying neural activity in young women who were playing a classic laboratory game called the Prisoner's Dilemma, in which participants can select from a number of greedy or cooperative strategies as they pursue financial gain, researchers found that when the women chose mutualism over 'me-ism,' the mental circuitry normally associated with reward-seeking behavior swelled to life. And the longer the women engaged in a cooperative strategy, the more strongly flowed the blood to the pathways of pleasure. The researchers, performing their work at Emory University in Atlanta, used magnetic resonance imaging to take what might be called portraits of the brain on hugs. 'The results were really surprising to us,' said Dr. Gregory S. Berns, a psychiatrist and an author on the new report, which appears in the current issue of the journal Neuron. 'We went in expecting the opposite.' The researchers had thought that the biggest response would occur in cases where one person cooperated and the other defected, when the cooperator might feel that she was being treated unjustly. Instead, the brightest signals arose in cooperative alliances and in those neighborhoods of the brain already known to respond to desserts, pictures of pretty faces, money, cocaine and any number of licit or illicit delights. 'It's reassuring,' Dr. Berns said. 'In some ways, it says that we're wired to cooperate with each other.' The study is among the first to use M.R.I. technology to examine social interactions in real time, as opposed to taking brain images while subjects stared at static pictures or thought-prescribed thoughts. It is also a novel approach to exploring an ancient conundrum, why are humans so, well, nice? Why are they willing to cooperate with people whom they barely know and to do good deeds and to play fair a surprisingly high percentage of the time? Scientists have no trouble explaining the evolution of competitive behavior. But the depth and breadth of human altruism, the willingness to forgo immediate personal gain for the long-term common good, far exceeds behaviors seen even in other large-brained highly social species like chimpanzees and dolphins, and it has as such been difficult to understand. 'I've pointed out to my students how impressive it is that you can take a group of young men and women of prime reproductive age, have them come into a classroom, sit down and be perfectly comfortable and civil to each other,' said Dr. Peter J. Richerson, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of California at Davis and an influential theorist in the field of cultural evolution. 'If you put 50 male and 50 female chimpanzees that don't know each other into a lecture hall, it would be a social explosion.' Dr. Ernst Fehr of the University of Zurich and colleagues recently presented findings on the importance of punishment in maintaining cooperative behavior among humans and the willingness of people to punish those who commit crimes or violate norms, even when the chastisers take risks and gain nothing themselves while serving as ad hoc police. In her survey of the management of so-called commons in small-scale communities where villagers have the right, for example, to graze livestock on commonly held land, Dr. Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University found that all communities have some form of monitoring to gird against cheating or using more than a fair share of the resource. In laboratory games that mimic small-scale commons, Dr. Richerson said, 20 to 30 percent have to be coerced by a threat of punishment to cooperate. Fear alone is not highly likely to inspire cooperative behavior to the degree observed among humans. If research like Dr. Fehr's shows the stick side of the equation, the newest findings present the neural carrot - people cooperate because it feels good to do it. In the new findings, the researchers studied 36 women from 20 to 60 years old, many of them students at Emory and inspired to participate by the promise of monetary rewards. The scientists chose an all-female sample because so few brain-imaging studies have looked at only women. Most have been limited to men or to a mixture of men and women. But there is a vast body of non- imaging data that rely on using the Prisoner's Dilemma. 'It's a simple and elegant model for reciprocity,' said Dr. James K. Rilling, an author on the Neuron paper who is at Princeton. 'It's been referred to as the E. coli of social psychology.' >>From past results, the researchers said, one can assume that neuro- imaging studies of men playing the game would be similar to their new findings with women. The basic structure of the trial had two women meet each other briefly ahead of time. One was placed in the scanner while the other remained outside the scanning room. The two interacted by computer, playing about 20 rounds of the game. In every round, each player pressed a button to indicate whether she would 'cooperate' or 'defect.' Her answer would be shown on-screen to the other player. The monetary awards were apportioned after each round. If one player defected and the other cooperated, the defector earned $3 and the cooperator nothing. If both chose to cooperate, each earned $2. If both opted to defect, each earned $1. Hence, mutual cooperation from start to finish was a far more profitable strategy, at $40 a woman, than complete mutual defection, which gave each $20. The risk that a woman took each time she became greedy for a little bit more was that the cooperative strategy would fall apart and that both would emerge the poorer. In some cases, both women were allowed to pursue any strategy that they chose. In other cases, the non- scanned woman would be a 'confederate' with the researchers, instructed, unbeknown to the scanned subject, to defect after three consecutive rounds of cooperation, the better to keep things less rarefied and pretty and more lifelike and gritty. In still other experiments, the woman in the scanner played a computer and knew that her partner was a machine. In other tests, women played a computer but thought that it was a human. The researchers found that as a rule the freely strategizing women cooperated. Even occasional episodes of defection, whether from free strategizers or confederates, were not necessarily fatal to an alliance. 'The social bond could be reattained easily if the defector chose to cooperate in the next couple of rounds,' another author of the report, Dr. Clinton D. Kilts, said, 'although the one who had originally been `betrayed' might be wary from then on.' As a result of the episodic defections, the average per-experiment take for the participants was in the $30's. 'Some pairs, though, got locked into mutual defection,' Dr. Rilling said. Analyzing the scans, the researchers found that in rounds of cooperation, two broad areas of the brain were activated, both rich in neurons able to respond to dopamine, the brain chemical famed for its role in addictive behaviors. One is the anteroventral striatum in the middle of the brain right above the spinal cord. Experiments with rats have shown that when electrodes are placed in the striatum, the animals will repeatedly press a bar to stimulate the electrodes, apparently receiving such pleasurable feedback that they will starve to death rather than stop pressing the bar. Another region activated during cooperation was the orbitofrontal cortex in the region right above the eyes. In addition to being part of the reward-processing system, Dr. Rilling said, it is also involved in impulse control. 'Every round, you're confronted with the possibility of getting an extra dollar by defecting,' he said. 'The choice to cooperate requires impulse control.' Significantly, the reward circuitry of the women was considerably less responsive when they knew that they were playing against a computer. The thought of a human bond, but not mere monetary gain, was the source of contentment on display. In concert with the imaging results, the women, when asked afterward for summaries of how they felt during the games, often described feeling good when they cooperated and expressed positive feelings of camaraderie toward their playing partners. Assuming that the urge to cooperate is to some extent innate among humans and reinforced by the brain's feel-good circuitry, the question of why it arose remains unclear. Anthropologists have speculated that it took teamwork for humanity's ancestors to hunt large game or gather difficult plant foods or rear difficult children. So the capacity to cooperate conferred a survival advantage on our forebears. Yet as with any other trait, the willingness to abide by the golden rule and to be a good citizen and not cheat and steal from one's neighbors is not uniformly distributed. 'If we put some C.E.O.'s in here, I'd like to see how they respond,' Dr. Kilts said. 'Maybe they wouldn't find a positive social interaction rewarding at all.' A Prisoner's Dilemma indeed. http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/23/health/psychology/23COOP.html?ex=1028415440&ei;=1&en;=2face896773fa4ea HOW TO ADVERTISE \--------------------------------- For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo For general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

[Being a 5 year translplant out here I say the best thing to do is bring     back the plans to make the state of Jefferson, then have Oregon,     Washington and Jefferson break away from the union.]          http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/09/23/oregon.assisted.suicide/          SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- The U.S.     Justice Department filed an appeal Monday to     overturn a federal judge's ruling that     upheld Oregon's doctor-assisted suicide law.          A spokesman for Oregon Attorney General     Hardy Myers said the state views the appeal     as 'same story, different day.'          Oregon voters approved doctor-assisted     suicide twice, in ballot initiatives in 1994     and 1997. But in November, U.S. Attorney     General John Ashcroft warned Oregon doctors     they would be prosecuted under federal law     if they prescribed lethal doses of drugs for     dying patients.

"Subject: Re: Re[3]: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...) Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with      no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to      be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la      Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts,      ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more      partners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether      the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely      promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get      even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other      men.                http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html          <>               As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme      promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the      Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses      how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you      might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having      many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an      explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.         That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of      Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played      in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many      others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that      there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.          Tom                 "

' as seen on national television ' ' making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home for an investment of only $ 25 us dollars expense one time . thanks to the computer age and the internet , be a millionaire like others within a year ! ! ! before you say , ' no way ! ' read the following . this is the letter you ' ve been reading about in the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a major nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of the program described below to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in this program . this has helped to show people that this is a simple , harmless , and fun way to make some extra money at home . and , besides even if you never got involved in the program , the reports themselves are well worth the money . they can help you start and advertise any business on the internet . that is , these reports stand alone and are beneficial to anyone wishing to do business on the internet . the results of this show have been truly remarkable . so many people are participating that those involved are doing much better than ever before . since everyone makes more as more people try it out , its been very exciting to be a part of it lately . you will understand once you experience it . ' here it is below ' * * * print this now for future reference * * * the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at . it can be started with very little investment ( $ 25 ) and the income return is tremendous ! ! ! this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave your house except to get the mail . simply follow the instructions , and you really can make this happen . this e - mail order marketing program works every time if you put in the effort to make it work . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non - commercialized method of advertising now ! the longer you wait , the more savvy people will be taking your business using e - mail . get what is rightfully yours . program yourself for success and dare to think big . it sounds corny , but it ' s true . you ' ll never make it big if you don ' t have this belief system in place . multi - level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi - level methods . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . you may have heard this story before , but donald trump made an appearance on the david letterman show . dave asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . without hesitating trump said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . the audience , started to hoot and boo him . he looked out at the audience and dead - panned his response . ' that ' s why i ' m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! ' with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again . in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided ' why not . ' initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not ' rip - off ' anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . here is the basic version of what you need to do : your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do . your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2 within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off , keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build . keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 , 1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done . by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it wasn ' t working . finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . ' the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to ' move up ' or ' get rich ' . inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with ' no risk ' and ' just a little bit of effort . ' you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now ! ' think about it . ' before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! you will definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! - jody jacobs , richmond , va here ' s how this amazing program will make you thousands of dollar $ this method of raising capital really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use up to $ 50 , 000 or more in the next 90 days . before you say ' no way ! ' please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multilevel businesses , we - build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multilevel business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come by mail and are filled by e - mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store , or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : this is what you must do . 1 . order all 5 reports shown on the list below ( you can ' t sell them if you don ' t have them ) . * for each report , send $ 5 . 00 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address , and your name & return address ( in case of a problem ) . * make sure your return address is on your envelope - in case of any mail problems ! * when you place your order , make sure you order each of the five reports . you need all five reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . * within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the five reports . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . 2 . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their order on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps ' a ' through ' g ' or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works you ' ll also see how it doesn ' t work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work . a . look below for the listing of available reports . b . after you ' ve ordered the . five reports , take this advertisement and remove the name and address under report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $ 50 , 000 ! c . move the name and address under report # 4 down to report # 5 . d . move the name and address under report # 3 down to report # 4 . e . move the name and address under report # 2 down to report # 3 f . move the name and address under report # 1 down to report # 2 . g . insert your name and address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name and address accurately ! copy and paste method works well , . 3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names , and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction portion of this letter . your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely you can afford $ 25 ) . you obviously already have an internet connection and e - mail is free ! to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much , much more . here are two primary methods of building your downline : method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000 programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 % response . using a good list , the response could be much better . also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the 0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 % response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to 10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000 + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do just that and more ! report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and e - mail software . method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet 1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10 downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50 2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500 3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000 4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000 5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000 this totals - $ 555 , 550 remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate !

"Subject: We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ 3.0 should support custom     fields. Histor URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020912.html      Date: Not supplied          We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields.      Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get      abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything      they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard.      End result: people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not      capturing all that information. You can always 'page fault' to get the      information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in      every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine      (this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be      relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the      programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be      dll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking      for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you      ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but      trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing      only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first      place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can      always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be      relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on      Windows 98SE? Aha! You can't. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not      every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so      this search doesn't make sense in the first place. The info wasn't captured. Do      a full text search for 98SE and you'll find some of them. Life is imperfect.)           Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of      information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on      the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's      workspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_,      which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I      have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking      package was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the      system, because they didn't know what all those fields were. The _real_      bug-'tracking' happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great.           A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, 'does      FogBUGZ support custom fields?' Rather than giving our usual answer ('no. on      purpose.') over the last few weeks I've been saying, 'can you please tell me      what fields you would need? We're trying to decide whether to implement that      feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it.' The interesting thing      is, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the      other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. And in fact, our      existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our      biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted      to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design,      but I didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track      of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are      happy and keep buying more site licenses.           But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking      software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in      our product. 'Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields.' Righto. It's true. And      who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to      yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a      built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and      inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But      it's still rude of me to tell customers that we don't have that feature _for      their own good_, even though it usually is, and we're losing some sales because      of it.           Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so      hard to use that people don't use it. At least we won't lose any sales :)          [1] http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ                 "

"Subject: [zzzzteana] Bomb Ikea http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2541827.stm Wednesday, 4 December, 2002, 08:52 GMT Bomber targets Dutch Ikea stores Police in the Netherlands are searching all 10 outlets of the Ikea furniture chain in the country, after finding bombs in two stores. The devices were discovered in Amsterdam and Sliedrecht, near the port city of Rotterdam on Tuesday evening. The Sliedrecht bomb exploded at a police station, injuring two policeman. Police have also closed off a motorway section in the central city Utrecht, near a third IKEA store where a suspicious package was found. No information about the motive behind the attacks has been released. 'We decided together with the police because of safety reasons that the company's stores in the Netherlands would be closed today,' said Ikea spokeswoman Helen van Trearum. 'We don't want to take any risks. We are taking this very seriously,' she added. Ikea - a Swedish-based group - is one of the world's largest furniture retailers, with stores in more than 30 countries. Meanwhile, the Amsterdam head office of the Dutch news agency ANP was evacuated on Wednesday, after police warned that a bomb might have been planted in the building.

"Subject: LP RELEASE: Outrageous military spending -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----          ===============================     NEWS FROM THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY     2600 Virginia Avenue, NW, Suite 100     Washington DC 20037     World Wide Web: http://www.LP.org     ===============================     For release: July 25, 2002     ===============================     For additional information:     George Getz, Press Secretary     Phone: (202) 333-0008 Ext. 222     E-Mail: pressreleases@hq.LP.org     ===============================          Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships     shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians say          WASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been      charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding      government-issued credit cards?          (a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases.          (b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes.          (c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf      membership.          (d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative 'river      rock' at a military base in the Arabian desert.          (e) all of the above.          'Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach,      Libertarian Party executive director. 'Thanks to the federal      government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked,      the military has launched a raid on your wallet.'          The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office      audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in 'seemingly      unneeded expenditures' made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and      2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax      credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees      carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1      billion in goods and services, the audit found.          In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and      government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars,      then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to      supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their      travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.          'Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a      strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling      suit?' asked Dasbach. 'Americans who support a bigger defense budget,      take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated,      reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the      worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even      imagine.'          Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury      cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and      armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.           Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit      noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can      be 'a useful tool for building good relations with a host country'      such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates.           Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found 'little evidence of      documented disciplinary action' against those who misused the cards,      so taxpayers may end up paying the tab.            'It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat      Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse      taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,' he said.           'Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard      against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to      force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country,      instead of offending the taxpayer.'               -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----     Version: 2.6.2          iQCVAwUBPUA6FdCSe1KnQG7RAQGAKwP/Zpfw0Uq3BPLnXXmnlWQ2aFFb1FSaj+nJ     QOMt9q4TBhiYJhIdgdd+uGxoubiPfvyIweSR1PjOdoFe8dYf2h/V4gNS9hSmkSgC     76RZVuitNf2DbEsaY8TtcUDLDC51m/jgxiGcgPkcyJ+0Wn11RRbktkVEefSNTaBz     M8ibVFiDPyI=     =9fYc     -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----                    -----------------------------------------------------------------------     The Libertarian Party                                http://www.lp.org/     2600 Virginia Ave. NW, Suite 100                    voice: 202-333-0008     Washington DC 20037                                   fax: 202-333-0072     -----------------------------------------------------------------------     For subscription changes, please use the WWW form at:      http://www.lp.org/action/email.html                 "

What people said about the first edition: 'an excellent printed resource on JSPs...I have been extremely impressed by its depth, clarity, and attention to detail. ' \--Reuven M.

"Subject: from abnamro bank dear sir / madam , i would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail . i am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication . i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . in 2001 , mr . ralph brink came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of eighteen million united states dollars , which he wished to have us turn over ( invest ) on his behalf . i was the officer assigned to his case , i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto chief operations officer of the private banking sector , especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advise to customers is to start by assessing data on 6000 traditional stocks and bond managers and 2000 managers of alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 20 million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2002 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in the netherlands . he directed that i liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in the netherlands . i informed him that abn / amro bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 10 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . i contacted my affiliate in amsterdam and had the funds available . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited at a amsterdam based security and consultancy firm . this asset management firm is a specialised private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well - connected organizations . in line with his instructions , the money was deposited with an asset management firm . mr . ralph brink told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from england later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 25 th february 2004 . in june later that year , we got a call from the asset management firm informing us of the the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit at the firm , and i could not understand why mr . ralph brink had not come forward to claim his deposit . all efforts to locate him was futile . i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of abn / amro . four days later , information started trickling in , apparently mr . ralph brink was dead . a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in canne , south of france . we were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate . if you are familiar with private banking affairs , those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity , but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes . in his bio - data form , he listed no next of kin . in the field of private banking , opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence , accounts are rarely held under a name ; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; mr . ralph brink died interstate . in line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away , we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate . this investigation has for the past months been unfruitful . we have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the problem . my official capacity dictates that i am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation . according to practice , the asset management firm will by the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim to abn / amro , failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to abn / amro bank . this will result in the money entering the abn / amro accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division . this will not happen if i have my way . what i wish to relate to you might sound unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . there is us $ 20 . 000 , 000 . 00 deposited in amsterdam , the netherlands , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as abn / amro is concerned , the transaction with mr . ralph brink concluded when i deposited the funds with the asset management firm , all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process . the asset management firm has no single idea of the history or nature of the deposit . they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward . this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man ' s family ; they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal ; i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the asset management firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . i can assure you that i could have the deposit released to you within a few days . i will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to mr . ralph brink i will then officially communicate with the asset management firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . if you find yourself able to work with me , contact me through the provided email account . if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a successful conclusion . . i do not want any direct official link between you and me . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . i strongly believe that you would not betray my confidence in you . please send your response to edwardlaan @ excite . it if we can be of one accord , we should plan a meeting , soon . i await your response . kind regards edward laan abn / amro bank private banking div . e - mail : edwardlaan @ excite . it check - out go . com go get your free go e - mail account with expanded storage of 6 mb ! http : / / mail . go . com "

"Subject: Using hosts file to rid yourself of popup ads Don't know if everybody knows this trick... Puts 127.0.0.1 as the IP for adservers. Elegant. == http://technoerotica.net/mylog/hostfile.html As mentioned throughout this site, there is more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to pop-ups. The hosts file is one of the most effective methods there is. In brief, a hosts file is a text file used by Windows to resolve domain names and IP addresses. If you're running windows, you already have a hosts file but it most likely isn't being used. What a hosts file does is simple, it lists domains and IP numbers. To get rid of ads, the hosts file lists the domain names of adservers along with the IP number 127.0.0.1. This tells windows to grab any content from the listed domain from the specified IP number. The specified IP number in this case is your own computer. What happens is that it won't display the ad. If you choose this method of ad removal there is no need to use our opt out links. The hosts file is a very effective mechanism. You can download this hosts file, unzip it and place it in your Windows directory. YOU SHOULD MAKE A BACK UP of your existing hosts file before you do. The hosts file is called 'hosts' there is no extension. You may have a file named Hosts.sam this is merely a sample hosts file. Once you download the file and put it in the windows folder, reboot your computer and it's a done deal. Pretty simple huh? You might want to look at the contents of this file as it contains additional information as well as an address for getting updated versions.  Because we're inherently lazy, this works for windows only, don't use it on a mac! Follow the address in the hosts file for alternative system instructions. download now  We didn't write this file and do not provide support for it's use. Follow the address in the hosts file for questions. It's not that we don't want to hear from you but the folks at this address have the answers you need. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork  "

"Subject: Re: sprint delivers the next big thing?? I can't see it either.           I do however disagree with Joe in that it needs to be 2+MPixels to      be useful.  Value is not always necessarily defined by quality      (just look at 802.11).          If I had a self-contained communications unit that let me share      things: documents, the weather, my new hairdo, by newborn baby,      etc. and it fit in my pocket then it might encourage me to share      those things more often.  If we're talking on the phone and you ask      me what the weather is like and I say 'hang on', outstretch the      device with my arm extended, press a button, and instantly send you      a picture on me with blue sky in the background, that has value.          But if I say 'hang on', fumble around in my briefcase for a digital      camera, and  after 5 minutes of plugging and praying with USB      finally am able to take a photo of me, bound by several feet of      cable and multiple devices, well, that doesn't really have value.          If I'm a Paparazzi I'd love to be able to send high-res photos      using my mobile phone because that has real economic impact, and I      could put up with the hassle for the amount of time it saves me.       However, I don't think that is the market that Sprint PCS is      contemplating.          The fact that Sprint has not made the assumption that both the      sender and recipient of the picture are using their mobile phones      will help this survive. Gets around the whole 'fax' problem (where      both sender and receiver have to have faxes in order for that      technology to be useful).          On the whole, not very useful for regular Joes (pun intended).  Put      the camera in the phone (even a low-res one) and then it'd at least      be cool.          -Ian.

"Subject: W3C approves HTML 4 'emotitags' - Now you'll be able to say it with feeling http://www.therockalltimes.co.uk/2002/04/08/new-tags.html W3C approves HTML 4 'emotitags' - Now you'll be able to say it with feeling by Lester Haines The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has approved a number of new html 'emotitags' which will revolutionise the web surfing experience. The tags have no physical effect, but rather elicit a strong emotional response from the reader. Top of the list is  (War on TerrorT). The tag, when judiciously applied, will immediately provoke violent anger against ragheads, thus: Charity agencies report that Iraqi leader Sadaam Hussein has adopted the African dictatorial habit of eating his political opponents. Of particular interest to British code-monkeys is the new  (I'm hurting too). This is designed for use when reporting on the life of Elizabeth the Queen Mother and other recently dead famous people: She touched our lives in so many ways with her common touch and her instinctive understanding of ordinary people. She will be sadly missed. The instantaneous effect is to reduce the reader to teary-eyed and self- indulgent wallowing in which he or she becomes unaccountably upset about the death of a complete stranger. Political reporting also looks to benefit from the new  tag. Any government ministerial pronouncement is thus rendered immediately transparent: Tony Blair was quick to defend transport secretary Byers, calling him 'the most honest man it has been my privilege to know'. And, in a much-needed boost to satire sites, W3C has formally ratified the controversial . This guarantees any text contained within it complete immunity from prosecution: Naomi Campbell, we can confirm, is a talentless, drug- addicted perjurer who believes that good looks alone can justify her appalling and obnoxious behaviour. The new tags have been warmly received by the programming community. W3C has, however, warned that they are to be used economically. It has further cautioned that they should never be used together, since the effect on the reader could be catastrophic: In response to reports that the Queen Mother had fallen victim to Sadaam Hussein's Axis of EvilT chemical weapons programme, Stephen Byers noted: 'She was everybody's favourite grandmother who touched the lives of billions. The only consolation we can gain from this tragedy is that all of the UK's trains will be running on time by next Monday. And you can quote me on that.' http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork  "

My knees are killing me from hauling stuff out of the basement for storage up in the attic, but the pile only made it as far as the kitchen. Then I stripped and painted the floor where that collection of stuff was previously stored, and erected some shelving so I'd have room for more stuff. I woke up the next morning discover a very sick ferret, likely from the fumes that leeched into the next room over despite the ventilation I had setup to prevent the migration of bad air. So, I ended up dismantling the ferret cage to move it upstairs for a week or so until I'm sure it's safe. Thankfully, all critters are doing well now.  I also started in on replacing the cheapo rusted screws with stainless steel deck screws out back, but found that the ones I picked up are too weak, leaving me with stripped out heads and bent shafts. That project stopped after barely getting started. The front steps are also in need of rust- proof screws, but they are made from much softer wood, so I moved the tools to the other side of the house. Two-thirds of the way through the first row, I found that the extra 1/2' on the screws I purchased was too much and I began running into the top of the old concrete steps underneath. Figures. Live and learn.  Oh well, it was entirely too hot to work outside anyway. Back down to the basement I went to geek out instead. Roughly an hour into geekitude, I glanced over and realized it was 78.7 degrees in the basement and I was virtually stuck to my chair from the sweat. I shut off as much as I really could and still work on a couple of projects, but it didn't help the heat situation much. It was just too hot outside for the air conditioner to keep up with the added heat from the computers. That left me in need of a shower and with only the notebook in the living room for the balance of the weekend. I cleaned out a lot of ancient email, which was nice, but nothing really got accomplished otherwise. Boy, am I tired. And the weekend is so far away.  Hey, the second season of M*A*S*H comes out on DVD tomorrow! That should put me in better spirits. I could watch M*A*S*H for hours on end. In fact, I often do just that. The only kink is that the episodes don't play back-to-back from DVD. I'm going to play with AppleScript on the Mac to see if I can customize how the individual discs play. In theory, I should be able to make a disc play all the way through. If I succeed, I'll be sure to share the script technique in the AppleCore newsletter. Too bad I can't do that with a stand-alone DVD player.  See You in August,   Randy Nieland         GnomeNETWORK      Slow File Save Dialog Boxes   Pointed out by Ian Hargreaves  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q321126  I've hated this one for a long time, and now we have a hotfix and a workaround, so take your pick as to which will work best. I often map drive letters to specific network shares, and if I happen to have a system turned off, I'll notice a significant delay when clicking the drop-down boxes in Open, Look In or Save In/As dialog boxes. Windows 2000 attempts to reconnect to mapped resources before showing you the list, and depending on how many drives you have mapped and how many of those resources are unavailable, it can take eons just to save a file. A workaround is to use the My Network Places functionality instead of mapping drive letters. Fine for some, but I prefer having drive letters mapped for many things, being that I work at a command prompt quite a bit, and it's easier to navigate that way. Alternatively, a hotfix is now available, but you'll have to contact Microsoft to obtain the fix if that's the route you choose.       GnomeSYSTEM      Customized 9x/ME Blue Screen Errors  http://www.vsres.com/blscrn/  We've all seen 'em. Those annoyingly incoherent blue screens indicating a system error of some sort, but provide no real help in solving the problem. If you're a programmer that has had to deal with error conditions produced by Windows 95/98/ME, then this might be a better way to handle them within your applications. Blue Screen v1.21 is an ActiveX control that uses the standard Windows system error functions, but provides a way to pass along text and response options you designate. Note that this is not functional on Windows NT/2000/XP, which handle system errors in an entirely different manner.     Gamers Beware of Intel 845G Chipset  http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4532   http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4513  Discount the AMD hype and returned volley from Intel when reading up on all of this, but one thing is painfully clear. The Intel 845G chipset and P4 Celeron processors really don't provide an acceptable gaming experience. Not only is performance subject to ridicule, but compatibility is also looking to be a serious matter. Intel has never claimed that Celerons were high-end desktop processors, but they have typically provided a decent enough experience that they can make for acceptable machines for the more budget-minded consumer. The compatibility issues with this particular version of Celeron and the 845G chipset are something to watch out for. Once the Celeron is moved to the .13 micron core, I suspect the performance concern won't remain, but the 845G alone seems to have it's own problems without adding the Celeron misery. The lesson in knowing what hardware you're buying is what's important here.

GnomeSTUFF      Too Cool  http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,102779,00.asp  This was just too interesting not to mention. Water-cooled systems are all- the-rage among overclockers and those that seem to need bragging rights over their friends' computer systems. Hitachi is taking a chapter from that tome and applying the concept where it's truly needed - notebook computers. Believe me when I say that these suckers get very hot. I spend half my life with notebook planted on lap, and I have to put something between the two surfaces to avoid my own little heat stroke. Fans and the mini water cooling system Hitachi is implementing provide roughly the same heat mitigation efficiency, but without the noise. The concept of a water-cooled notebook sounds a little odd, but I would welcome the elimination of the turbine droning with open arms.

"Subject: Deep-fried Twinkies take America by goo URL: http://boingboing.net/#85481504      Date: Not supplied          Carny concessionaires have taken to selling deep-friend Twinkies, doing big      business with artery-clogging horripilations:               In what may be the biggest setback for the war on fat since supersize          fries, Americans are scarfing down thousands of the gooey, calorie-laden          snack cakes at county fairs and restaurants across the country.               'We sold 26,000 Twinkies in 18 days. People drove for hours just to taste          our Twinkie,' said Rocky Mullen, who sells the deep-fried, cream-filled          treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of          Seattle.               As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add          chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top...               Hearing about Mr. Sell's invention, Hostess, the company that makes the          71-year-old snack, started promoting deep-fried Twinkies to state and          county fairs, where a captive population of junk-food addicts began          gobbling them up between pig races and tractor-pull competitions.               How bad are they for your health? After deep-frying, a Twinkie packs an          estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat.

People in council houses are 'worthless and lazy'. Ramblers are 'nosy perverts'. Nicholas van Hoogstraten, a man who once paid for a hand-grenade attack on a business rival, shows Emma Brockes around his Sussex palace and explains why he's so keen to keep the riff-raff away Friday September 8, 2000 ... On the way down from the roof, through the 'workers' quarters' which Van Hoogstraten intends to fill with staff from Zimbabwe, he returns to the subject of peasants, expanding on the 'worthless' and 'lazy' majority who make up the council estates of this country. 'You are playing up to your villainous image,' I suggest. Van Hoogstraten looks momentarily embarrassed. 'I'm not villainous,' he mumbles. I ask if he regards the people who work for him in these derogatory terms, and he says no, because they work hard and hard labour is what distinguishes the 'riff-raff' from the 'elite'. I ask him if being a person of quality is merely a matter of wealth. He says no, and refers to some of his wealthy neighbours, 'old-moneyed bastards' whom he regards as being as primitive in their idleness as 'those rat bags drawing social security.' ... He was in the Bahamas when President John F Kennedy was shot, and amidst the public mourning, remembers being pleased. 'I was glad,' he says. 'He was only in it for the ego trip.' He claims similar feelings on hearing news of Diana's death, while returning from France on a ferry. 'She made us look like fools,' he says. 'She made a mockery of the royal family.' Van Hoogstraten's relationship with authority is riddled with contradictions. He says he hated Diana because she was thick, but when you point out that the rest of the royal family are pretty thick too, he says gloopily, 'they are all we've got, so we have to respect them.' He says he favours dictatorship as the best form of government, but complains that some of the officials he has dealt with in Mugabe's Zimbabwe are impossible because 'the power has gone to their heads.' (Mugabe himself is the most modest man he has ever met, he says, and he is friends with Ian Smith, who apart from the small matter of his hysterical racism, he finds charming). Margaret Thatcher is the only leader he has ever admired, because she made him feel 'proud to be English'. ... The 'van' is of course a late affectation - always an indication of a genuine dickhead.

! ! follow the simple instruction below and your financial dreams will come true , guaranteed ! instructions : = = = = = order all 5 reports shown on the list below = = = = = for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of the report you are ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems . = = = when you place your order , make sure = = = = = = you order each of the 5 reports ! = = = you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them . your total cost $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 . within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer . important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it will not work if you change it . remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work ! ! ! people have tried to put their friends ' / relatives ' names on all five thinking they could get all the money . but it does not work this way . believe us , some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed . because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! ! this is a legitimate business . you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it . treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time . 1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune . 2 . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 . 3 . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 . 4 . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 . 5 . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2 6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position . please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! this is critical to your success . * * * * take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do not make any other changes . save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data . to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this venture going : method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but let ' s just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e - mails instead of only 5 , 000 each . continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with orders . that ' s 100 people who responded and ordered report # 2 . those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 . those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 5 million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 . that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) . your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ? there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming online every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it . always provide same day service on all orders . this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report . = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = the reason for the ' cash ' is not because this is illegal or somehow ' wrong ' . it is simply about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper , write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail address and your name and postal address . place your order for these reports now : report # 1 : ' the insider ' s guide to advertising for free on the net ' order report # : 1 from rui sousa santos p . o . box 132 taylors lakes vic 3038 australia report # 2 : ' the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net ' order report # 2 from : richard moulton p . o . box 82 hot springs , mt 59845 usa report # 3 : ' secret to multilevel marketing on the net ' order report # 3 from : j . siden krondikesvdgen 54 a 83147 vstersund sweden report # 4 : ' how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net ' order report # 4 from : francis kidd p . o . box 209 homestead , pa 15120 usa report # 5 : ' how to send out one million emails for free ' order report # 5 from : j . johns p . o . box 277806 sacramento , ca 95827 usa $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ follow these guidelines to guarantee your success : = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails until you do . = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for report # 2 . if you do not , continue advertising or sending e - mails until you do . * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a different report . you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ! ! ! following is a note from the originator of this program : you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on every one of them . remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent . it is up to you now !

"Subject: I was such an ugly baby...      Forwarded-by: Chris Wedgwood      From: Bert          01. I was so poor growing up...  if I wasn't a boy...  I'd have had         nothing to play with.          02. A girl phoned me the other day and said, 'Come on over; nobody's         home.'  I went over. Nobody was home.          03. During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me.  Just the         other night she called me from a hotel          04. One day I came home early from work...  I saw a guy jogging         naked. I said to the guy, 'Hey buddy, why are you doing that?'  He         said 'Because you came home early.'          05. It's been a rough day. I got up this morning...  put a shirt on         and button fell off.  I picked up my briefcase, and the handle         came off.  I'm afraid to go to the bathroom.          06. I was such an ugly kid...  When I played in the sandbox, the cat         kept covering me up.          07. I could tell my parents hated me.  My bath toys were a toaster and         radio.          08. I was such an ugly baby...  My mother never breast fed me. She         told me that she only liked me as a friend.          09. I'm so ugly...  My father carries around a picture of the kid who         came with his wallet.          10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to         my father, 'I'm sorry. We did everything we could, but he pulled         through.'          11. I'm so ugly...  My mother had morning sickness...  AFTER I was         born.          12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of         my finger to my father.  He said he wanted more proof.          13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me         find my parents. I said to him, 'Do you think we'll ever find         them?' He said,'I don't know kid. There's so many places they can         hide.'          14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.          15. I'm so ugly...  I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how         big I'd get.          16. I went to see my doctor. 'Doctor, every morning when I get up and         I look in the mirror...  I feel like throwing up; What's wrong         with me?' He said...  'I don't know but your eyesight is perfect.'          17. I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping         pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.          18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, 'How can I get my         kite in the air?' He told me to run off a cliff.          19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves         a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm.  Last night he went on         the paper four times - three of those times I was reading it.          20. One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control.          21. My uncle's dying wish was to have me sitting in his lap; he was in         the electric chair.                 "

"Subject: Sony gets handed a set back in Ausyland http://www.abc.net.au/news/justin/weekly/newsnat-26jul2002-53.htm PlayStation owners win copyright case Owners of PlayStation consoles who modify their machines to play games bought overseas have had a win in the Federal Court. Sony Computer Entertainment has failed in its claim that 'chipping' breaks copyright laws. Sony launched legal proceedings against a Sydney man, Eddy Stevens, for allegedly selling pirated games and also providing and installing modification chips. PlayStation consoles in Australia are different from those in the US and Japan because of the different television formats. The court was told 'chipping' allows people to play legitimately bought overseas games and copies of games, but also pirated games. The judgement by Federal Court Justice Ronald Sackville says Sony failed to prove that PlayStation consoles have a copyright protection measure installed in the first place and therefore could not rule that a mod chip breaks copyright legislation. Mr Stevens was found to have infringed trademark rules in relation to the pirated games he sold a matter which will come before the court again next month. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork  "

"Subject: The Beer Scooter [I'm sure somebody will tell me about the original source; it's in a number of places on the web. -gkm] Forwarded-by: Colin Burgess  The Beer Scooter How many times have you woken up in the morning after a hard night drinking and thought 'How on earth did I get home? As hard as you try, you cannot piece together your return journey from the pub to your house. The answer to this puzzle is that you used a Beer Scooter. The Beer Scooter is a mythical form of transport, owned and leased to the drunk by Bacchus the Roman god of wine. Bacchus has branched out since the decrease in the worship of the Roman Pantheon and has bought a large batch of these magical devices. The Beer Scooter works in the following fashion:- The passenger reaches a certain level of drunkenness and the 'slurring gland' begins to give off a pheromone. Bacchus or one of his many sub-contractors detects this pheromone and sends down a winged Beer Scooter. The scooter scoops up the passenger and deposits them in their bedroom via the Trans-Dimensional Portal. This is not cheap to run, so a large portion of the passenger's in-pocket cash is taken as payment. This answers the second question after a night out 'How did I spend so much money?' Unfortunately, Beer Scooters have a poor safety record and are thought to be responsible for over 90% of all UDI (Unidentified Drinking Injuries). An undocumented feature of the beer scooter is the destruction of time segments during the trip. The nature of Trans-Dimensional Portals dictates that time will be lost, seemingly unaccounted for. This answers a third question after a night out 'What the hell happened?' With good intentions, Bacchus opted for the REMIT (Removal of Embarrassing Moments In Time) add on, that automatically removes, in descending order, those parts in time regretted most. Unfortunately one person's REMIT is not necessarily the REMIT of another and quite often lost time is regained in discussions over a period of time. Independent studies have also shown that Beer Goggles often cause the scooter's navigation system to malfunction thus sending the passenger to the wrong bedroom, often with horrific consequences. With recent models including a GPS, Bacchus made an investment in a scooter drive-thru chain specialising in half eaten kebabs and pizza crusts. Another question answered!! For the family man, Beer Scooters come equipped with flowers picked from other people's garden and Thump-A-Lot boots (Patent Pending). These boots are designed in such a way that no matter how quietly you tip-toe up the stairs, you are sure to wake up your other half. Special anti-gravity springs ensure that you bump into every wall in the house and the CTSGS (Coffee Table Seeking Guidance System) explains the bruised shins. The final add-on Bacchus saw fit to invest in for some scooters is the TAS (Tobacco Absorption System). This explains how one person can apparently get through 260 Marlboro Lights in a single night. PS: Don't forget the on-board heater, which allows you to comfortably get home from the pub in sub-zero temperatures, wearing just a T-shirt.  "

Under way, ask her if she'd like to take     the stick. Back at slip, cook her dinner.

If     she wants to try it again, another day, she shows     promise. If she asks you to show her the V berth, you     have a girlfriend.

It was clear you were talking about averages. But it should      be equally clear that that isn't what people mean when they     use the word 'promiscuity'.           > >which seems to rob it of its common meaning:      > >activity above some specific threshold (usually 'one')      >      > In that case, 'promiscous' is a vacuous term in modern Western     > societies (but we knew that :), where people average 7 partners or so     > in their adult lives.          Not at all. There are still people who only have one partner.     There are many more whoe only have one partner over 'long'     periods of time. So it is far from 'vacuous' to describe some     people as 'promiscuous' and others as 'not promiscuous',      especially over a set period. ('He was promiscuous in college.     He is no longer promiscuous.')          The word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency      to gloss that meaning over with population averages.           > >Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females.     > >[...]     > >so in this contrived population, females are more 'promiscuous' than males,     >      > So 1 girl gets 1 guy, 2 girls get 2 guys, 2 guys get 1 girl, 1 guy     > gets 3 girls.  Sounds like six of one versus half a dozen of the other     > to me.          OK, then. Consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each     pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him 'Wilt',     also has sex with the other 499,999 women.           499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have     only had one partner. It is now 'perfectly obvious' that in the     common meaning of the term, among this contrived population,      that women are 'more promiscuous' than men -- even though the     single 'most promiscuous' person, Wilt, is a man.            'Promiscuity' is not 'exactly, perfectly identical between males      and females', except under a degenerate custom definition of     'promiscuity'.          > >unless 'promiscuity' is defined uselessly.     >      > Ain't nothin' useless about averages.          Averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their      actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.          - Gordon                      "

"Subject: Cost-Effective MLM/Bizop Phone-Screened Leads      Hello,                              Premium Phone Qualified             Business Opportunity Leads                   If you're spending money marketing a Business Opportunity or MLM,            you will definitely be interested in             what we have to offer you.                                               You're tired of blindly spending money for leads and not having             any idea what kind of response you'll get from it.  Sometimes            calling 100 people without one single signup!  Sometimes             talking to people who have been bombarded by bizop pitches            to the point of them hanging up when you call!  (Leads oversold)                   We're here to help!                    We'll get you qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity.                    Period.                    No qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense.                    We'll do it quickly, and professionally.                    And we won't ask you for a single dime without guaranteeing results!                               Here's How We Generate Our Leads...                   - All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!                   - One source we use for Lead-generation is a Business Opportunity            Seeker Lead List of people who have requested info. about making             extra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,            or responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.                   - The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.            We have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,            plays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in            making money from home.  If they are, the system records their            name and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.                   - The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then            PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices and the following             info. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):                   Name:            Email:            Phone:            Best time to call:            State:            Reason they want to work from home!:            How much they want to make per month:            How much time they can commit per week:            How much money they have available for startup:            If they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:                   We'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no            more than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.                   - Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you,             from which the results are then forwarded to you by email.                   - This way, you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time*             (only minutes old).  Never more than 24 hours old.  Guaranteed!                   - We GUARANTEE that you'll receive AT LEAST a valid Name,             Phone Number and the Time-Date Stamp corresponding to when            the Lead was generated!  However, almost ALL leads will have            ALL of the information asked above.                               Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:                   1. They will be Extremely Qualified due to the nature of the             qualifying questions that will be asked (above).                   2. They are Super-Fresh!  Delivered in Real-Time only moments             after they are contacted and qualified!  (Not 30-120 days old)                   3. They're Targeted.  Each Lead we generate originates from a            targeted list of business opportunity seekers.                   4. They're Highly Receptive!  Receptivity is very, very high             because they aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching             them on opportunities!  Also they'll remember speaking to             someone over the phone.  Especially since we tell them to             expect your call!                   5. No 'feast or famine' activity.  Leads will be coming in             regularly.  You dictate the flow!                   6. No more cold calls!  We tell your prospects you'll be calling.                   7. You can *personalize* your approach with the info. you             get with each Lead!                   8. Save Time.  Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.                   9. Lower 'burnout' factor.  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier             to pick up the phone, day in and day out.                   10. You can sort your Leads based on their responses and call the            hottest ones first.                   11. You can get new reps started quicker using these Leads due             to higher closing ratios.  Of course, this builds faster and stronger             momentum, and skyrockets 'new rep retention' as a result of             'quick successes'.                   12. The Leads will be uniform - almost all leads will have the info.             indicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)                   13. They're double-qualified because to generate the Lead,             a list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.                   14. Excellent control of the flow of Leads coming through.                   If you've been trying to run things too long without a steady flow of high            quality leads, call us NOW to get things in motion.  Just let us know             what program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized             lead-generation campaign for you.                    Since your need to get business moving has probably never been             more critical than it is today, why not call us NOW!                   These are fresh, highly qualified leads because these people aren't             just responding to some 'Generic Business Opportunity' ad, they're             contacted over the phone specifically for YOUR company!  And we             forward you the leads within minutes of the lead being generated - not             days, weeks, or months!

"Subject: [vox] Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire (fwd) Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online 'anarchist scavenger hunt' proposed for next week's annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire of police, who fear demonstrators could damage property and wreak havoc. Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points. Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate executive or World Bank delegate. D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities were in talks to decide whether planned protests were, 'so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to take proactive action.' Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next weekend. The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic blockade, banner-drops and protests against major corporations in the downtown core. Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name, told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke. 'People were asking for things to do when they come to D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they don't do the boring, standard stuff,' he said. 'I doubt people will actually keep track of what they do for points.'  "

If we had more variety of franchise food than the Wendys/KFC/PizzaHut/TacoBell/TimHorton's monopoly (they are all Pepsi under the hood, aren't they?), things might be different. When a New Yorker has biscotti, we have a timbit, when a Parisienne has a croissant, we have a timbit ... because that's all we can buy.

"Subject: Football players addicted to video football URL: http://boingboing.net/#85531549 Date: Not supplied Pro football players are addicted to football games, as a means of wish-fulfillment -- by 'managing' the team, they can be free of the rule of their coaches and bosses. Maybe this explains the amazing success of The Sims, which, on the face of it, should be dull as hell: While away your free time away from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a day-job and a drive to acquire consumer goods on credit. You'd think it'd be the last thing you want to do. But it's not. When you're a Sim, you can tweak your existence a smidge, discover what life would be like if you took Path A instead of Path B, try the alternate universe on for size. The idea of football players playing themselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of the Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O's at the supermarket and asks where he can find the 'Burns-O's.' 'It's always a trip,' Carr says. 'The first time I saw myself in a video game was in college (at Fresno State) when I walked into a Best Buy store and some kid was playing with me. That kind of trips you out a little bit.' For every 12-year-old kid who spends countless hours in front of a television playing video games, there's a group of 300-pound offensive linemen challenging each other at everything from Madden NFL 2003 to the action-packed 'Halo: Combat Evolved.'

"Subject: judicial judgements - child support bgs  you for your interest ! judgment courses offers an extensive training course in ' how to collect moneyjudgments ' if you are like many people , you are not even sure what a money judgment is and why processing money judgments can earn you very substantial income . if you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a money judgment against them . you are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact : its now up to you to collect on the judgment . the court does not require the loser to pay you . the court will not even help you . you must trace the loser down , find their assets , their employment , bank accounts , real estate , stocks and bonds , etc . very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found . the result is that millions of judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten . in 79 % of the cases the winner of a judgment never sees a dime . the non - payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedmoney judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 8 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing money judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of money judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today our company and our associates have over 126 million dollars in money judgments that we are currently processing . of this 126 million , 25 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid money judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non - confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor doesn ' t know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful money processing are as follows : mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with money judgments . ( we train you how to find out who to write to ) 8 % to 11 % of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help . they call you , you don ' t call them unless you want to . you send them an agreement ( supplied in the course ) to sign which splits every dollar you collect 50 % to you and 50 % to them . this applies no matter if the judgment is for $ 2 , 000 . 00 or $ 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 . you then go on - line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets . we offer over 120 powerful reports to assist you . they range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus , to bank account locates , employment locates , skip traces and locating stocks and bonds , etc . the prices of our reports are very low . typically 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of what other firms charge . for example we charge $ 6 . 00 for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge $ 25 . 00 . once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located . ( standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course ) when you receive the assets you keep 50 % and send 50 % to the original judgment holder . once the judgment is fully paid you mail a satisfaction of judgment to the court . ( included in the course ) quote ' s from several of our students : thomas in area code 516 writes us : ' i just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course . my first week , part time , will net me 3 , 700 . 00 dollars . your professionalism in both the manual and your support . you have the video opened doors for me in the future . there ' s no stopping me now . recently thomas states he has over $ 8 , 500 , 000 worth of judgments he is working on ' after only having this course for four months , larry s . in area code 314 stated to us : ' i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now ' after having our course for 7 months larry s . in 314 stated ' i am now making $ 12 , 000 . 00 per month and have approximately $ 500 , 000 . 00 in judgments i am collecting on . looks like i will have to hire someone to help out ' marshal in area code 407 states to us ' i feel bad , you only charged me $ 259 . 00 for this course and it is a goldmine . i have added 3 full time people to help me after only having your course for 5 months ' > from the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following : with our course you can own your own successful business . a business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in 3 - 5 years , paying you enough to retire on and travel the world . a business which is extremely interesting to be in . a business in which every day is new and exciting . none of your days will be hum - drum . your brain is challenged . a business , which protects you from corporate downsizing . a business which you can start part time from your home and later , if you so desire , you can work in full time . a business , which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do . a business , which lets you control your own destiny . our training has made this happen for many others already . make it happen for you ! if the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being , no cost or obligation on your part . please call us at 1 - 2 ` 8 ` 1 - 5 ` 0 ` 0 - 4 ` 0 ` 1 ` 8 . we have service support staff available to you from 8 : 00 am to 10 : 00 pm ( central time ) 7 days a week . if you callthis number you can talk to one of our experienced customer support personnel . they can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation . sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations of courses . when you call our customer support line they can let you know of any specials we may be running . if you like what you read and hear about our courses , then the customer support person can work with you to place your order . we are very low key . we merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to work with us or not . thank you for your time and interest . + + + + + this ad is produced and sent out by : uas to be e r a s e d from our mailing list please email us at smiley 82 @ 168 city . com with ' e r a s e ' in the sub - line or write us at : adminscript - update , p o b 1 2 0 0 , o r a n g e s t a d , a r u b a + + + + + + { % rand % } , , , , , , , , , , to 48 6 - 03 c 29 p my heart and my soul are lifted to you . i offer my life to you everything i ' ve been through use it for your glory .

"Subject: 75 % reduction in road accidents august , 2002 dear sir / madam , in case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have been re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody . we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than seventy - five percent we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva . there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings : statistics advantages options economics we are looking for the followings : 01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . ) ( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ . ( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces ( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide more than 2 billion us $ per day . ( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day ) theadvantages of the technology developed by us : a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially . b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression . by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all . c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced . as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be : 2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ . d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further . e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels . 3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion . f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind . g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind . h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future . i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also . . among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options available to us : - a - outright sale ( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration . ( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in ' a ' . the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price . b - licencing options i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis . ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world . c - combined options a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement . the economics of the project will be as follows : - 1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation . 2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle . but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided . 3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective . 4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles . 5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from . 6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency . 7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ . 8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date . 9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years . 10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle . 11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing . 12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate . p . s . 1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct . 2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .

"Subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards On August 7th, an entity known as 'iDEFENSE' sent out an announcement, which is appended to this email. Briefly, 'iDEFENSE', which bills itself as 'a global security intelligence company', is offering cash for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell anyone else. If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure. At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research known as 'full disclosure'; people who discover security vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem \--- they publish the information, including code to exploit the vulnerability, if possible. This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call 'responsible disclosure' --- never release working exploit code, and never release any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released a patch. This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem was. The underground computer criminal community would often discover and exploit these same holes for months or years while the 'responsible disclosure' process kept their victims, who had no connections in the underground, vulnerable. The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software, turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and detecting and responding to intrusions. They are therefore much less useful to would-be intruders. Also, software companies usually see security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as long as possible. iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous than either of the two previous paradigms. They want to be a buyer in a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash. Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if HP retained Snosoft's 'consulting services'. HP considered this extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the information. If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which, together, add up to a catastrophe. First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to the highest bidder, and to nobody else. For reasons explained later, I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers. Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will become lucrative for many more talented people. The result will be \--- just as in the 'responsible disclosure' days --- that the good guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority of current vulnerabilities are kept secret. I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's plausible. If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example. Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web- site administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars. I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to execute the largest heists without getting caught. Inevitably, that means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who are good at networked theft may not yet exist. There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR than a gang could make by theft. Think of a remote-root hole in Samba, for example. Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits. Creating a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly increase the availability of that information to the people who can afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime. Let's not let that happen. This is the original iDEFENSE announcement: From: Sunil James [mailto:SJames@iDefense.com] Sent: Wednesday, August 07, 2002 12:32 PM Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program Greetings, iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code. iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following provides answers to some basic questions about the program: Q. How will it work? A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number of motivations, including the following: * Pure love of security research * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following items: * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit) * The amount of detail and analysis provided * The potential severity level for the information shared * The types of applications, operating systems, and other software and hardware potentially affected * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE Q. Who should contribute to the VCP? A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other entity. Q. Why are you launching this program? A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the public at large are warned in a timely manner. Q. Who gets the credit? A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or exploit information. Q. When can I contribute? The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today. To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please contact us at contributor@idefense.com. Regards, Sunil James Technical Analyst iDEFENSE 'iDEFENSE is a global security intelligence company that proactively monitors sources throughout the world -- from technical vulnerabilities and hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code. The iALERT security intelligence service provides decision-makers, frontline security professionals and network administrators with timely access to actionable intelligence and decision support on cyber-related threats. iDEFENSE Labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities, examines the behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new software/hardware weaknesses in a controlled lab environment.' http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork  "

"Subject: Fw: The Gold Buddha In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task. When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter. After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before him a huge solid- gold Buddha. Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our outer shell, piece by piece. Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why don't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could. They are taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every month and don't even realize it.

"Subject: Apple: Heinous DVD Pirates URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000644 Date: 2002-10-08T01:21:33-06:00 DeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because it makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many ways encouraged. *Tools:* 1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work) 1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work) 1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 'Jaguar' *Process:* 1\. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for you. 2\. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to your hard drive. Ejct the DVD. 3\. In DVD Player, select 'Open VIDEO_TS Folder...' from the File menu. Use the dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. *Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.  "

"Subject: [ILUG] Create a PAYCHECK with your COMPUTER and Enjoy Cheap ISP & shopping Discount. Hi - ( http://club.4tfox.com ) You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money. Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money. And they expect you to listen to them? Enough. If you want to make money with your computer, then you should hook up with a group that is actually DOING it. We are making a large, continuing income every month. What's more - we will show YOU how to do the same thing. This business is done completely by internet and email, and you can even join for free to check it out first. If you can send an email, you can do this. No special 'skills' are required. How much are we making? Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month. We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time. But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work, and rake in the cash. That kind of job does not exist. But if you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be just the thing you are looking for. This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is done FOR you - it is all based on your effort. But, as I said, there are no special skills required. And this income is RESIDUAL - meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase each month also). Interested? I invite you to find out more. You can get in as a free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you decide it is not for you. We are just looking for people who still have that 'burning desire' to find an opportunity that will reward them incredibly well, if they work at it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind. Looking forward to hearing from you! Sincerely, Hugh Zou P.S.

This is different - there is value, integrity, and a REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business... and finally make real money on the internet.

"Subject: project qin wang lloyds tsb pacific limited hong kong branch fax : + 852 - 301 - 66259 thank you for giving me your time . please be patient and read my email to you . i am a staff of lloyds tsb group attached in private banking services . i am contacting you concerning a customer and , an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago , i contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication and i would like to intimate you with certain facts that i believe would be of interest to you . in 2000 , the subject matter ; ref : bb / tsb / bank / 73 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking services department . he informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8 . 35 million united states dollars , which he wished to have us turn over on his behalf . i was the officer assigned to his case ; i made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de - facto chief operations officer of the private banking services department , especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank . we met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed . i encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings . the favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and alternative investments . based on my advice , we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation , the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 10 million united states dollars , this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments . in mid 2001 , he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in europe . he directed that i liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm in europe . i informed him that our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process , the bank would have to make a 9 . 5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges . he complained about the charges but later came around when i explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us . cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9 / 11 . i contacted my affiliate in europe and had the funds available in main land europe . i undertook all the processes and made sure i followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm , the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash . this small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well - connected organizations . in line with instructions , the money was deposited . he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from norway later that week . this was the last communication we had , this transpired around 20 th june 2002 . in june last year , we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio . this was an astounding position as far as i was concerned , given the fact that i managed the private banking sector i was the only one who knew about the deposit , and i could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit . i made futile efforts to locate him i immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of our bank . four days later , information started to trickle in , that he was apparently dead . a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in cannes , south of france . we were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was confirmed . the bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate . if you are familiar with private banking affairs , those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity , but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes . in his bio - data form , he listed no next of kin . in the field of private banking , opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence , accounts are rarely held under a name depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous . this bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself , ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as i said , rarely do they nominate next of kin . private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care , in this case ; he died in testate . what i wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but i want you to understand something . it is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational . the world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios . you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what i propose . there is us $ 8 , 370 , 000 . 00 deposited , i alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless i instruct them to do so . i alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm , the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when i sent the funds to the firm , all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just customer services and due process . the finance firm has no single idea of what ' s the history or nature of the deposit . they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward . this is the situation . this bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man ' s family ; they have investigated for months and have found no family . the investigation has come to an end . my proposal , you share similar details to the late fellow i am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation . upon receipt of the deposit , i am prepared to share the money with you in half and no more . that is : i will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you . we share the proceeds 50 / 50 . i would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me , but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit . but on the other hand , you with a similar name as the original depositor would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim . i assure you that i could have the deposit released to you in a few days . i will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer . i will then officially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you . with these two things : all is done . the alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as accountholder . this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm . we can fine - tune this based on our interactions . i am aware of the consequences of this proposal . i ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail . i ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive . if my offer is of no appeal to you , delete this message and forget i ever contacted you . do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal . you may not know this but people like myself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector . i am not a criminal and what i do , i do not find against good conscience , this may be hard for you to understand , but the dynamics of my industry dictates that i make this move . such opportunities only come ones ' way once in a lifetime . i cannot let this chance pass me by i hope you understand because for once i found myself in total control and face to face with my destiny . these chances won ' t pass me by . i ask that you do not destroy my chance , if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me . i am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities . there is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking . i have evaluated the risks and the only risk i have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank . i am the only one who knows of this situation , good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life . let ' s share the blessing . if you give me positive signals , i will initiate this process towards a conclusion . i wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels ; i will deny knowing you and about this project . i repeat , i do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do i want you contacting me through my official email account . contact me only through this email address ( q _ wang @ o 2 . pl ) i do not want any direct link between you and me . my official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our total quality management policy . please observe this instruction religiously . please , again , note i am a family man ; i happily married with two kids . i send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences might be , but i know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold . this is the one truth i have learned from my private banking clients . do not betray my confidence . if we can be of one accord , we should plan a meeting , soon . i await your response . sincerely , qin wang * este mensaje fue enviado desde http : / / www . enterate . com . ar / * conectate gratis a internet desde enterate ! usuario : enterate @ enterate . com . ar clave : enterate desde buenos aires : 4004 - 8007 desde otras ciudades , consulta en : "

My problem is not the same as MS's one, I don't have to deal with millions of      identical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each      download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is      a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers,      you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we      think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients      personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible      steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.          I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy      in a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market      penetration.          BTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I'm playing with      gdb's dissassembler now but I don't think it's what a typical cracker would      use.

Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that      advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a      product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where      consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this.           There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first      rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our      immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium      to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial.      And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead      of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.

"Subject: NYTimes.com Article: Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good This article from NYTimes.com has been sent to you by khare@alumni.caltech.edu. Sure does explain FoRK :-) not yet abandoned, Rohit khare@alumni.caltech.edu Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good September 10, 2002 By MARY DUENWALD Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years, scientific research has suggested that people who have strong friendships experience less stress, they recover more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible to the common cold, studies show. But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie, insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. 'Friendship is often very painful,' said Dr. Harriet Lerner, a psychologist and the author of 'The Dance of Connection.' 'In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy, envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it.' Another book, 'When Friendship Hurts,' by Dr. Jan Yager, a sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford, advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside. 'There's this myth that friendships should last a lifetime,' Dr. Yager said. 'But sometimes it's better that they end.' That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering that they have only recently paid close attention to friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships - between siblings or parents and children - have been seen as more important. Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go bad. As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr. Lerner said, 'Never once have I had anyone write and say my best friend hits me.' Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes, like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the role of friends in emotional and physical health. 'Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for stability the way it was in the past, and because people are less likely to be living with or near extended family members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as a way of building community and finding intimacy,' said Dr. Fehr, the author of 'Friendship Processes.' Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship focused on its health benefits. 'Now we're starting to look at it as a more full relationship,' said Dr. Suzanna Rose, a professor of psychology at Florida International University in Miami. 'Like marriage, friendship also has negative characteristics.' The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said. So far they have only, through surveys and interviews, figured out that it is a significant problem. The early research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised pursuit. 'When you think of people who were friends at Enron,' she added, 'you can see how friendship can support antisocial behavior.' Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. 'When friends split up,' said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of psychology at the University of South Carolina, 'it is often in cases where one has shared personal information or secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.' Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. 'It's more than just pulling away,' she said. 'The silent treatment is actually malicious.' At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr. Lerner's patients. 'I would not encourage her to hang in there and work this one out,' Dr. Lerner said. A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her 'a derogatory name.' The woman, now 32, was so devastated that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with people ever since, Dr. Yager said. Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse, but it is 'more insidious,' Dr. Yager said. 'Some people constantly set up their friends,' she explained. 'They'll have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or she finds out.' Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. Most common is the promise breaker. 'This includes everyone from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but something always comes up at the last minute to someone who promises to be there for you when you need them, but then isn't,' Dr. Yager said. Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do, when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons to dislike the other one. 'With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to discover there's something important they don't like about the other person,' said Dr. Rose of Florida International. 'One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense, it may take even more time for one person to meet the other's dislike criteria.' Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said, 'depends on how large the injury is.' 'Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let something go,' she added. 'It's also an act of maturity sometimes to accept another person's limitations.' Acceptance should come easier among friends than among spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one friend and do not need a full range of emotional support from each one. But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to get together, ever. 'It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship, but only one to end it,' Dr. Yager said. Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a bad friendship should leave a person with more time and appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. 'It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have them in order while you're healthy and your life and work are going well,' she said. 'Because when a crisis hits, when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and life- preserving good friendship is.' http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/10/health/psychology/10FRIE.html?ex=1032684795&ei;=1&en;=2a88a6d1b985c977 HOW TO ADVERTISE \--------------------------------- For information on advertising in e-mail newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with The New York Times on the Web, please contact onlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media kit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo For general information about NYTimes.com, write to help@nytimes.com.

Ouch....'(was Re: My brain hurts) This thread is starting to rapidly decay ... these are old bits which I cannot explain exactly why I thought they were important now or why I went rummaging through back folders to find them or even why I felt compelled by a deep sense of inner purpose to post them here ... http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/stories/2238.html 20 NEW SIGNS THAT YOU WERE ABDUCTED BY SPACE ALIENS! WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- You may have been abducted by space aliens -- and not even know it! Psychiatrists, psychologists and UFO experts say millions of people all over the world have been kidnapped by extraterrestrials. But most of them can't recall the experience because the memory is so painful that they've buried it deep in their subconscious minds. But there are strong tip-offs that you may be one of the millions who have encountered beings from another planet, if you know what to watch for. Experts at Wake Forest University here, as well as other respected institutions around the world, offer 20 startling new indicators that you may have had a close encounter: 1\. You experience unexplained nausea or a strange sense of uneasiness around the same time each day. 2\. You have an unusual new scar or strange mark on your body -- particularly on the roof of your mouth or behind an ear. 3\. You often find yourself hungry for oranges or lemons -- even after you've had a large meal or eaten enough food to fill your stomach. Researchers at Oslo University say this hunger for citrus is common in alien abductees. 4\. You have a strong, ever-present feeling that there is some mission or important thing you're supposed to do in life and you find yourself constantly driven to achieve it or discover what it might be. 5\. You often find yourself going through your trash, or the trash of others, without knowing exactly what you're looking for. Swiss UFO researchers found that people who have been abducted often find themselves unaccountably digging through refuse. 6\. You frequently dream of cattle. Psychologists at the University of Paris say it's common for the subconscious mind to substitute a cow or bull for an alien being. 7\. You feel you're 'special' or 'chosen.' 8\. You are a vegetarian -- but can't exactly explain why. 9\. You have an overpowering feeling of dread when you see photos or drawings of space aliens. 10\. You are prone to addictive or compulsive behavior. This in itself is not necessarily indicative of alien abduction. But if there are other indicators as well, you could be an abductee. 11\. You wet the bed. Studies in Peru show there's a connection. 12\. You have frequent insomnia. 13\. You are strangely intrigued by old western movies. Psychologists say they can't yet explain abductees' fascination with cowboy movies, but they say it exists in at least 75 percent of victims. 14\. Electronic devices often go haywire around you for no discernible reason. 15\. You have seen -- or think you've seen -- a mysterious, hooded figure in or near your home more than once. 16\. Your fingers are stiff, numb or unresponsive for more than an hour after you wake up. 17\. You have had -- or currently have -- severe back or neck problems. 18\. You frequently experience a ringing in one ear. 19\. You often get sinusitis or other nasal pain. 20\. You are frequently haunted by the sense that you're being watched. \-- Gary Lawrence Murphy  TeleDynamics Communications Inc Business Innovations Through Open Source Systems: http://www.teledyn.com 'Computers are useless.

"Subject: goldeditor : charting gold for dummies - an interview with reinhard goldeditor : charting gold for dummies - an interview with reinhard www . goldeditor . com this week gold broke out to new 16 year highs - a great time to get our favorite technical guru , richard reinhard , editor of growth stocks weekly , to give us some of his thoughts on the price of gold ( i know , expectations only cause heartbreak ) . goldeditor interviewed reinhard and he explains in simple detail the mega trend bullishness on gold from a technical point of view . ( don ' t ask him on the fundamentals - he could go on forever ) . sit down in front of the fire and enjoy : goldeditor : why do you emphasize charting , aka technical analysis , when making your investment decisions ? reinhard : technical analysis separates emotions from logic . if we all have the same completely logical expectations prices would only change when quarterly reports or relevant news was released . this would make investing easy . technical analysis ( ta ) is the process of analyzing a security ' s historical prices in an effort to determine probable future prices . we compare current price action ( current expectations ) with comparable historical price action to predict a reasonable outcome . only a small minority of technicians can consistently and accurately determine future prices . however , even if you are unable to accurately forecast prices , technical analysis can be used to consistently reduce your risks and improve your profits . the price of a security represents a consensus - one person is buying and another is selling . the price at which an investor is willing to buy or sell depends primarily on his expectations . if he expects the security ' s price to rise , he will buy it ; if the investor expects the price to fall , he will sell it . ta is based almost entirely on the analysis of the resulting price and volume as evidenced via a chart . a picture truly is worth a thousand words . think of security prices as the result of a head - to - head battle between a bull ( the buyer ) and a bear ( the seller ) . the bulls push prices higher and the bears push prices lower . the direction prices actually move reveals who is winning the battle . support and resistance areas form where strong emotions occur , and can be penetrated by a change in investor expectations ( a shift of the supply / demand lines ) . this type of a change is often abrupt and news based , and often emotional . a trend represents a consistent change in prices ( changing investor expectations ) . trends differ from support / resistance levels in that trends represent change , whereas support / resistance levels represent barriers to change . the use of ta , essentially observing the clues and actions of the crowd , allows you to divorce yourself from what they are feeling . somewhat clinically , you are in a position to anticipate their actions and so act either ahead , with or counter to the crowd - providing a much more timely ( higher probability ) basis for investment decisions . ta provides a basis or frame of reference using a logical and consistent approach that minimizes risks and maximizes opportunities . most investors spend their time looking for easy money ( which is not an easy search ) instead of learning the key factors to security prices - - supply and demand . goldeditor : what are some different technical indicators you use , what do they measure and how do you interpret them ? reinhard : moving averages are one of the oldest and most popular technical analysis tools representing the average price of a security at a given time . many other indicators exist that are beyond a simple explanation , including several of our favorites : fibonacci retracements , relative strength index and on - balance - volume . any good book on ta will explain these clearly to students of the markets . basically , there are three distinct types or classes of indicators , which provide insight into : 1 . the external monetary conditions affecting security prices . this tells us what security prices should do . 2 . the sentiment of various sectors of the investment community . this tells us what investors expect prices to do . 3 . the current momentum of the market . this tells us what prices are actually doing . goldeditor : what are your thoughts on the mega trend in the us dollar ? reinhard : the us dollar is in a secular bear market . you can ' t open a financial newspaper or watch the financial news channels without hearing about the dollar bear . this trend became technically apparent in early 2002 , just like the mirror - image gold price lift - off , yet the press typically provided little if any coverage . with the us dollar ( $ us ) index finally breaking 85 support in recent weeks and gold breaking through the us $ 430 - 435 resistance , we are now clearly starting the next big upwave on gold . the markets are looking somewhat like a rabbit in the road staring at oncoming headlights - frozen in disbelief , fear or confusion . the lag in the gold stocks is symptomatic - but once the trends accelerate away from these key resistance ( gold ) / support ( $ us ) areas there will likely be a rush by the undecided - resulting in an accelerating trend that will surprise the mainstream . there are several technical reasons and many fundamental reasons why a major $ us interim bottom isn ' t likely here and the trend is nowhere near approaching its ultimate end . technically the us dollar index is trading high up in its downtrend near resistance with overhead resistance now building a wall . to see this graphically visit www . gsweekly . com of course the dollar needs to periodically bounce or that fear would get out of hand . technical bounces are a normal part of major downlegs , bleeding off excessive fear and rebalancing investor sentiment . but make no mistake about it , we seeing a slow - motion crash of the us dollar . key to remember is that all major commodities are denominated in us dollars , the world ' s de facto reserve currency . if the dollar is falling , you need more dollars to buy oil or wheat or steel or any commodity . commodity prices across the board are responding to the dollar ' s weakening , but gold has a particularly strong correlation as it is effectively a currency alternative . gold has broken out to 16 - year highs and other metals are following suit . aluminum is selling at multi - year highs , as is copper , lead , silver and nickel . grain prices are surging . if we ' re right about the long - term direction of the dollar ( does it have any choice ? ) , these gains are just the beginning . click here for a usd index chart goldeditor : can you simplify the long term technical story behind gold ? reinhard : in the late ' 90 s gold sank below $ 260 an ounce as the dow headed over 12 , 000 . this was in hindsight the best possible time to leave the roaring tech - boom party and reposition for what will likely be considered the trade of the decade - buy gold . one problem - there was no one ringing the bell that gold had hit an historic bottom ! then in april 2001 gold hit a 21 - year low near $ 250 , very similar to the lows of 1999 , thereby forming a double - bottom . sentiment was understandably negative , with headlined high - profile central bank sell - offs , and predictions of sub - $ 200 gold . as is fairly typical , gold chose its darkest hour to turn into a new secular bull market only now starting to get some mainstream recognition . it ' s easy to focus on the day - to - day ripples , but it ' s the intermediate waves and the secular direction of the tide that really determines where the big money is made , and this big picture perspective continues to set the tone for our somewhat unique early - stage , well - pedigreed , small - cap resource - sector investment focus . ta monitors supply and demand - the key elements that determine price . as long as demand exceeds supply , prices will rise over the long term . the fun to be had is when this equilibrium price is a fair ways away from the status quo , and for many reasons i believe this to be the case . global gold supply only grows incrementally each year because of the difficulty and huge capital costs required to bring new gold deposits to market . gold is a relatively small market where a demand shift leads to magnified price adjustments , especially because unlike a typical commodity , gold is a unique store of value . the key to any secular gold bull is the demand or supply that private investors generate as they buy or sell gold , as this market represents about 80 % of gold ownership . the collective gold transactions of millions or even billions of individual investors worldwide buying and selling gold will ultimately set the price . perversely , in the investment world the higher the price an investment climbs the greater demand becomes . virtually no one wanted anything to do with gold near $ 250 a few years ago , but anyone around in late 1979 through to january 1980 witnessed the madness of the crowd as gold rapidly accelerated to its peak at over $ 850 per ounce . the key to understanding any market bubble ' s distinct parabolic curve is to understand the shifting investment demand over the life of a secular bull . the higher the investment price , the more attention it attracts , the higher demand grows , the higher the investment price goes - a virtuous circle . gold is ultimately a store of value , money , so far simply appreciating to counter the devaluing us dollar . many currencies such as the euro and the commodity - based canadian dollar are also appreciating strongly relative to the us dollar . when gold starts appreciating from the foreign investors ' home - currency perspective , maybe as a result of their government ' s determination to remain competitive through competitive devaluation or a lowering of interest rates , the rush to own gold should accelerate . click here for a three year gold chart goldeditor : so many people have said that gold ' s critical level is $ 430 - why is that ? reinhard : gold has often been repulsed by overhead supply at this price point , although the number $ 430 has no particular significance other than to be well north of where resistance is usually met . just earlier this year enthusiastic gold investors were financially bagged when gold ' s largely uninterrupted run from the january 2001 $ 250 area double bottom came to an abrupt halt on january 13 2004 at $ 426 , corrected to $ 390 , ran again to $ 427 in april ( a double top ! ) and then plunged to the $ 375 area in short order . this of course caused magnified volatility amongst the junior gold stocks . looking back further , this is the same area that marked the january 1996 peak , january 1990 top , january 1987 resistance and even the late 1979 correction before the breakout to the ultimate $ 850 secular peak . for whatever reason , demand seems to meet supply in this area , and of course the market ' s always right ! on october 25 , 2004 gold closed at $ 429 , to me a key close and the highest since february 1990 ' s high close of $ 424 . interestingly , gold has barely pulled back at all these last 3 weeks ( the low was $ 424 on 2 days ) and in fact has been trading consistently above $ 430 with progressively higher closes since november 4 . today ' s close ( november 16 ) was $ 439 . 40 . can you spell stealth breakout ? goldeditor : is $ 430 the big support level now ? reinhard : the $ 425 area has built up significant support over the last month . any significant breakdown through the area would of course be a cold shower for the gold market , causing no small amount of painful readjustment to some leveraged portfolios as offside investors liquidate . interestingly , this is not an extended , over - bought market . in fact , many traders and gold bugs would have faded into this key resistance zone - that is , sold as price entered the resistance area . this is the reason old resistance becomes new support once breached decisively . trader ' s remorse is a well - known phenomenon . market traders who sold and investors who missed the run are now even more anxious to ( re ) establish positions , hoping to see price come back , and afraid to chase the price up . goldeditor : has gold broken out for good ? reinhard : yes . gold has now broken out and is on a trend that is unlikely to change for some time . the trend remains intact until it is broken . right now from both a fundamental and technical perspective i ' m convinced that we are setting up for a run to test the $ 480 - 500 area . goldeditor : where do you think the next major resistance level is ? reinhard : a re - visit to gold ' s long term chart shows that once the $ 430 area is cleared next resistance will be met at around $ 500 , and above that it ' s about $ 720 . again , this is historical and based on several distinct data - points separate in time , lending some confidence to each level ' s ongoing significance . $ 500 also has that large round number psychological aspect to it . goldeditor : how does investor psychology affect charting patterns and technically ? reinhard : some key observations investors need to consider : 1 . price represents the fair market value as agreed between buyers ( bulls ) and sellers ( bears ) . 2 . changes in price are the result of changes in investor expectations of the security ' s future price . 3 . support levels occur when the consensus is that the price will not move lower . it is the point where buyers outnumber sellers . 4 . resistance levels occur when the consensus is that the price will not move higher . it is the point where sellers outnumber buyers . 5 . the penetration of a support or resistance level indicates a change in investor expectations and a shift in the supply / demand lines . 6 . volume is useful in determining how strong the change of expectations really is . 7 . traders ' remorse often follows the penetration of a support or resistance level as prices retreat to the penetrated level . which means what ? the sellers feel stupid for having sold and want back in ! goldeditor : technically speaking where do you think the critical level is for gold to hold for the bull market remain intact ? reinhard : if one looks at the 4 - year chart , effectively covering the double - bottom of early 2001 and the full move of this first phase of what is now a new secular bull market , a clear channel can be plotted which bounds the higher - lows and higher - highs with parallel up - trend lines . today , to break the bottom trend line we would need to see price break down through the $ 390 area , and then there still exists major support at the old resistance band around the $ 375 level . a break in the established uptrend would not negate the bull market , but a breakdown through major support would put it in jeopardy - effectively the lows of april 2004 would need to be breached to the downside . goldeditor : why are some of the gold stocks not breaking out with the price of gold ? reinhard : actually very few gold stocks are breaking out or achieving new highs along with the price of gold . there are probably several reasons for this , but a major one has to be investor ' s reluctance to buy when price is perceived to be at the top of a trading range - a been there , done that , won ' t do that again psychology . this will change once the gold price leaves this range behind and investors start to believe there ' s upside . a once bitten twice shy memory is strong - fear will need to be overcome by greed . another factor to consider is that there was a record amount of financings last year as long - suffering juniors took advantage of the first wave to load up the treasury at relatively cheap prices . there ' s a lot of paper that needs to be absorbed . the hui gold share index has gained about 600 % over the last 3 - 1 / 2 years and most investment managers and retail brokers missed the market . typically any bull market ' s first phase is marked by denial and this one is no different . by the time phase two progresses to the point that average people start to become aware and accept that this is for real , we should see some serious professional capital to inflow to the sector . once the senior companies do become fully or overvalued in anticipation of gold ' s continued rise , there will be a natural migration of investment capital to the undervalued intermediate and then junior sectors . because it takes three to five years to find a decent discovery , and another several years to build a mine - there ' s no quick way to catch up for the lack of exploration and development of the 1997 - 2002 resource slump , and so to position into perceived value will mean buying into deserving early - stage opportunities now , or pay - up down the road . resources are now scarce , and the competition from investors , funds , mining companies and foreign countries will only become more intense until somehow supply increases to the point where demand is met - and this is unlikely to occur for several years . goldeditor : do you buy strictly on technical behaviors or do you combine technical behavior with fundamentals and why ? reinhard : you need both . there have been many scams and market manipulations where the technicals were orchestrated to be compelling . likewise , the fundamentals are often manipulated ( remember bre - x ) in an effort to deceive . at least with bre - x the technicals would have stopped you out even as the story remained compelling . it ' s never a good idea to ignore one entirely , although if i had to make a choice , technical analysis and good money management discipline is all one needs to make consistent returns . goldeditor : what is your biggest trading rule ? ( i . e . never average down , first loss is always the best lost etc . ) reinhard : a rising tide raises all ships , and vice versa , so assess the tide , not the ships . some honorable mentions that have served me well : be patient : don ' t be rattled by fluctuations . when all you ' re left with is hope , get out . never catch a falling knife . cut your losers , and let your winners ride . bear markets begin in good times . bull markets begin in bad times . draw trendlines . if a stock is in a downtrend don ' t go long , and visa versa . if you learn one candlestick pattern , learn doji at the top of a trend . contrarians are correct at turning points in the market , but wrong the rest of the time . goldeditor : what books do you recommend for the beginning trader ? reinhard : technical analysis of the financial markets : a comprehensive guide to trading methods and applications by john j . murphy trading for a living : psychology , trading tactics , money management by alexander elder financial reckoning day : surviving the soft depression of the 21 st century by william bonner reminiscences of a stock operator by edwin lefvre goldeditor : richard , thank you for your insights on the price of gold . i ' m sure your technical expertise has helped many of our subscribers be better investors . we are going to do an update with you in six months . we look forward to talking to you then . to unsubscribe from this publication , please click on the box below . gold editor po box 48451 bentall centre vancouver , bc v 7 x la 2 canada "

AP) - InfoSpace Inc. chairman and chief executive Naveen Jain will step down from his posts once the Internet services and software company finds a replacement. Jain, a former Microsoft executive, founded InfoSpace six years ago and led the company through its rise and fall. His departure from the top posts was announced Wednesday. With its stock now trading for dimes, InfoSpace is in danger of being delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market. The company is asking shareholders to approve a one-for-10 reverse stock split to prop up the price. If approved on Sept. 12, shareholders would trade in 10 shares of stock for one new share. The company has had trouble retaining its top-level executives in the past, including most recently, former chief executive Arun Sarin who resigned last year after just nine months on the job. The company said Jain will remain as a company employee. Shares of InfoSpace fell 2 cents to 43 cents in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork  "

"Subject: escrow affiliate - part - time work at home opportunity baltia capital investment ltd . , the leading private equity investor in the baltic states , offers you an opportunity to join our team on a position of escrow affiliate . this home - based job does not require any in - depth knowledge of finance or a great investment of time . if you believe that you are an orderly and responsible person with some multi - task skills , this is a great opportunity for you to get a substantial additional income without much effort . looks like another work - by - email scam ? read on to find out why it is not . about us baltia capital investment was founded in 1995 to provide exciting investment opportunities to institutions and individuals who believed in the potential of the emerging markets of baltic states and former soviet union countries . over the years , the performance of our funds remained ahead of the expectations of our investors , and we have built a healthy reputation in the eastern european investment market . we are now looking at establishing local presence in the us and canada , where household investors grow dissatisfied with the financial market performance and standard investment vehicles . we are eager to offer private equity opportunities that combine our investment expertise and the amazing potential of the emerging markets . however , there is a major obstacle on our way : the 2001 patriot act . the grievous events of the september 2001 were not only a display of great villainess of the islamic fundamentalism , but also a catalyst for the us market being effectively barred for the new european financial companies . if you would like to learn more about our company , please feel free to visit us online at www . baltiacapital . com . how you can help at the moment , us patriot act forbids international clients to hold bank accounts in the us banks . all investment transactions made to eastern european and baltic companies by individuals are also subject to great and often unnecessary scrutiny , which brings a lot of inconvenience both to investment companies and their clients . as a small company working on a highly competitive market , we do not want to load our american clients , who are chiefly private , not - so - affluent investors with the additional expense associated with the upkeep of a duly registered us office . that is why we are looking for escrow agents in the usa and canada who will be able to receive the electronic bank payments on behalf of our company and forward the funds to our client account , retaining an escrow commission . what you will need to do as soon as you join our team , you will be assigned an online cabinet in our corporate website employee section . there you will be able to trace all payments made to your designated account for further transfer to the designated client investment account . you will also see the amount of the commission due to you , calculated on the basis of your experience of successful cooperation with our company . all you questions will be handled by your individual supervisor . your reward your escrow commission is calculated on the following table : amount transferred , total commission rate $ 50 , 000 - $ 150 , 000 12 , 5 % $ 150 , 000 - $ 500 , 000 15 % $ 500 , 000 and over 20 % your escrow commission is deducted directly from the amount that you receive for further transfer . that means that you do not have to wait till the end of the month to receive your reward . instead , you receive the commission as soon as you transfer the money to the client investment account . example jill escrow joins our company and receives a $ 35 , 000 payment from john investor on the first week . her commission constitutes 10 % x $ 35 , 000 = $ 3500 . she retains this amount and forwards the remaining $ 31 , 500 to the client investment account . next week , she receives a $ 20 , 000 . her commission equals 10 % x $ 15 , 000 + 12 , 5 % x $ 5 , 000 = $ 2125 . whats next if you are tempted by the offer , feel free to email a brief resume to escrowprogram @ baltiacapital . com , and a hr manager will be in touch with you shortly .

After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, the future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry that have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems mean opportunity. 'Every major industry in the history of the United States has experienced a similar transformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,' says Robert Saunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market research firm. Christopher Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says 'We are seeing all the people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money and for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few millions.' Read the full story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end of this newsletter.  >>>  >>> As we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe this company will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.  >>>  >>>   >>>  >>> Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential  >>>  >>> We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), share price began to explode in April of this year moving from just over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but today has a market cap of $267 million.  >>>  >>> IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right for investors to get in on the ground floor.  >>>  >>>   >>>  >>> The InDigNet Strategy  >>>  >>> InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious 'Diamond' level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for Cisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building a communication network. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company recently completed its acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. InDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, or 33% of the country's total market, and this spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years. Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.  >>>  >>> The IGTT web site: www.indiginet.com  >>>  >>>   >>>  >>> The IT Market  >>>  >>> Based on recent studies, the country's 7.4 million SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including Internet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland.

The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, and data.  >>>  >>>   >  2\.

IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first year of production with no increases in acquisitions.

"Subject: panda ranks famous people used to spread computer viruses panda software ranks famous people most often used to spread computer viruses a coordinated attack with four species of malware featuring an image of michael jackson marks a resurgence in the use of famous names to distribute malware on the internet . the recent distribution of a new type of malware , detected by panda software as downloader . dbr , by mass mailing messages to users around the world and using a spoof story about a suicide attempt by michael jackson , is nothing more than a new episode in social engineering : exploiting the popularity of certain celebrities to increase the propagation of this type of threat . the strategy used to spread this malware is actually quite complex : the message , which has been distributed manually as spam across the internet , contains a link to web page . this page , by means of an example of malware detected by panda software as phel . j , exploits a browser vulnerability to insert inor . ak , an html application , on computers . this in turn provides the access needed to install downloader . dbr on the user ' s computer . however the malicious chain doesn ' t end there . once installed on computers , this trojan downloads the au variant of the dedler worm , which actually takes the malicious action on the infected computer . this is not the first time that michael jackson has been used as bait to distribute this kind of threat : last november a mail was distributed supposedly containing a link to a website from which users could download a video of jackson with a child . this video did not exist , but instead a trojan was downloaded onto the computer . even though it is not usual for such complex coordinated techniques to be used to install malware on computers , the names of celebrities are frequently used to distribute mails which either contain malware attached to the mail itself ( often camouflaged as an image ) , or which contain a url where the malware is accessed ( as in this case ) . trojans in themselves do not generally have the capacity to propagate ( as worms do ) , and so this type of strategy is needed for the message to spread . at the top of this particular celebrity virus ranking is britney spears , who , according to data from pandalabs , has been the involuntary protagonist of most attacks over the last years . attractive female celebrities are often used for these purposes as the excuse for sending the mail is often to entice users with the promise of interesting photos . along these lines , third and fourth respectively in the ranking come jennifer lopez ( unfortunately associated to the famous loveletter ) and shakira . porn stars are also often used for this purpose . the second person most frequently used by malware creators to distribute their works is microsoft owner , bill gates , and fifth in the list is osama bin laden . the latter has been the subject of e - mails claiming that he has been hung , or finally caught , and the spread of these messages increased after the iraq war . other famous people who have been used in this context include anna kournikova , who was the subject of a widespread example of malware bearing her name , bill clinton , pamela anderson , and even alberto fujimori , the former president of peru . the ranking of famous people most frequently used is : position name britney spears bill gates jennifer lopez shakira osama bin laden michael jackson bill clinton anna kournikova paris hilton pamela anderson to prevent infection from these and other malicious code , panda software advises users to keep their antivirus software updated . panda software customers already have the updates at their disposal to detect and disinfect this new malicious code . to help as many users as possible scan and / or disinfect their computers when necessary , panda software offers panda activescan , which now also detects spyware , free of charge at www . pandasoftware . com . webmasters who would like to include activescan on their websites can get the html code , free of charges , at www . pandasoftware . com / partners / webmasters . panda software also offers users virus alerts , an e - bulletin in english and spanish that gives immediate warning of the emergence of potentially dangerous malicious code . to receive virus alerts just visit panda software ' s website ( www . pandasoftware . com ) and complete the corresponding form in the virus alerts section . for more information about these and other malicious code , visit panda software ' s virus encyclopedia at : panda software 230 n . maryland ave . , ste . 303 glendale , ca 91209 this e - mail message is an advertisement and / or solicitation .

' you must never try to send any command to that address , as it would be distributed to all the people who have subscribed . all commands must be sent to the ' listserv address , ' listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . it is very important to understand the difference between the two , but fortunately it is not complicated . the listserv address is like a fax number that connects you to a machine , whereas the list address is like a normal voice line connecting you to a person . if you make a mistake and dial the fax number when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone , you will quickly realize that you used the wrong number and call again . no harm will have been done . if on the other hand you accidentally make your fax call someone ' s voice line , the person receiving the call will be inconvenienced , especially if your fax then re - dials every 5 minutes . the fact that most people will eventually connect the fax machine to the voice line to allow the fax to go through and make the calls stop does not mean that you should continue to send faxes to the voice number . people would just get mad at you . it works pretty much the same way with mailing lists , with the difference that you are calling hundreds or thousands of people at the same time , and consequently you can expect a lot of people to get upset if you consistently send commands to the list address . you may leave the list at any time by sending a ' signoff frbnyrmagl ' command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . you can also tell listserv how you want it to confirm the receipt of messages you send to the list . if you do not trust the system , send a ' set frbnyrmagl repro ' command and listserv will send you a copy of your own messages , so that you can see that the message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way . after a while you may find that this is getting annoying , especially if your mail program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that new mail has arrived from frbnyrmagl . if you send a ' set frbnyrmagl ack norepro ' command , listserv will mail you a short acknowledgement instead , which will look different in your mailbox directory . with most mail programs you will know immediately that this is an acknowledgement you can read later . finally , you can turn off acknowledgements completely with ' set frbnyrmagl noack norepro ' . contributions sent to this list are automatically archived . you can get a list of the available archive files by sending an ' index frbnyrmagl ' command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com . you can then order these files with a ' get frbnyrmagl logxxxx ' command , or using listserv ' s database search facilities . send an ' info database ' command for more information on the latter . important : this list is confidential . you should not publicly mention its existence , or forward copies of information you have obtained from it to third parties . please note that the ' give ' command is automatically disabled for all archive files . more information on listserv commands can be found in the listserv reference card , which you can retrieve by sending an ' info refcard ' command to listserv @ peach . ease . lsoft . com ."

"Subject: Still looking for a house? My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.           I need those houses...          Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use 'unconventional' private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.)           I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not.

"Subject: [zzzzteana] FWD (SK) Re: Quotation wanted [pseudoscience - a skeptic's view] The material appended below comes from Martin Gardner's book _Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science_ -- revised and expanded edition published in 1957 by Dover Publications, Inc. (New York City). Bill Bennetta _________________________________________________ '[M]ost pseudo-scientists have a number of characteristics in common. 'First and most important of these traits is that cranks work in almost total isolation . . . in the sense of having no fruitful contacts with fellow researchers. . . . The modern crank insists that his isolation is not desired on his part. It is due, he claims, to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new ideas. . . . 'The modern pseudo-scientist . . . stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated. He works in isolation. He does not send his findings to the recognized journals, or if he does, they are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent. In most cases, the crank is not well enough informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance to a significant study. As a consequence, he finds himself excluded the journals and societies, and almost universally ignored by the competent workers in his field. In fact, the reputable scientist does not even know of the crank's existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through non-academic channels, or unless the scientist makes a hobby of collecting crank literature. The eccentric is forced, therefore, to tread a lonely way. He speaks before organizations he himself has founded, contributes to journals he himself may edit, and -- until recently -- publishes books only when he or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed privately. 'A second characteristic of the pseudo scientist, which greatly strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward paranoia. . . . 'There are five ways in which the sincere pseudo- scientist's paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited. '(1) He considers himself a genius. '(2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, as ignorant blockheads. Everyone is out of step except himself. Frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of stupidity, dishonesty, or other base motives. If they ignore him, he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable. If they retaliate in kind, this strengthens his delusion that he is battling scoundrels. . . . '(3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated against. . . . '(4) He has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the greatest scientists and the best established theories. When Newton was the outstanding name in physics, eccentric works in that science were violently anti Newton. Today, with Einstein the father symbol of authority, a crank theory of physics is likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton. . . . '(5) He often has a tendency to write in a complex jargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases he himself has coined. . . .' \-- Terry W.

This is true, statistically, because most > people are poor and most people are also stupid. I never said that rich people are smart, just less stupid than most other people. And most people who are poor do engage in more reckless and stupid behavior in my experience; the people that are a bit smarter don't stay poor for long, so it is a self- selecting population. Hell, I grew up in as abject a poverty as you can find in the US and I remember quite well why the people that stayed poor were poor -- it certainly wasn't because of The Man. And my parents were poor because they made lots of stupid choices -- I had front row seats to the whole process. Unlike many others, I actually learned from the experience. And I've known a lot of wealthy people (both in a strict monetary sense and general sense), and I can't think of a one that was a fool. People who earned their wealth (i.e. 95+% of the wealthy in the US) didn't manage to do so, and maintain their wealth, because they were fools. It isn't that these people are that much smarter, they just don't make lots of bad decisions and stupid mistakes. Being very smart AND not making lots of stupid mistakes is pretty much a surefire recipe for being wealthy. > Being smart, for example, has made Stephen Hawking famous and > respected, but he's not particularly rich.

You are using a very narrow definition of 'smart'. Smart doesn't make you rich, it gives you the *choice* to be rich. Many people (e.g. Stephen Hawking) are quite happy merely being comfortable and devote their energy elsewhere than being 'rich'. But I don't know too many really smart people that actually choose to live in poverty. > [...ridiculous caricature of wealthy people elided...] > At the granular level, the notion that 'most rich people are rich > because they're smart' is so anecdotal and naive that it's not > worth arguing about, so I won't. Still, a compelling point worth > some clarification. It sounds like you've bought into the absurd Hollywood depictions of what wealthy people are like. Hint: they are exactly like you and me, but with a higher net worth. In the U.S., the fact is that two-thirds of the millionaires are blue collar folks who worked very smart and very hard, and the vast majority of all the wealthy in the U.S. are completely self-made (i.e. first-generation wealthy). 'Old wealth' is incredibly rare in the U.S., as it typically comes and goes within three generations, and the handful that you do hear about are the unusually long-lived exceptions. It's quite simple to become wealthy in the U.S. if you put some effort into it. However, most people prefer to merely be comfortable and expend a lot less energy. Virtually all the people I know who are wealthy are chronic workaholics with above average intelligence and exaggerated amounts of drive. Most people would not consider those people's lives 'fun', though those people tend to enjoy what they do. -James Rogers jamesr@best.com http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork  "

What is the reason to write a registry key to a server if the server itself is not using it? I don't think you should worry too much about someone travelling out of the hive, but again, I'm curious as to how the driver actually modifies the keys on the server. > (2) The risks of a compromise to the client (far more likely).

And if the client writes the key back onto the server, yes, there's wide open for something nasty here. Two other things spring to mind; 1) If anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects. 2) If anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the registry. The result of such a thing is obvious. If I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell me where I might have misunderstood.

"Subject: message subject think getting a 1 . 95 % rate is impossible ? think again ! we can offer you the absolute rock - bottom lowest rate , guaranteed . we work with all credit types . visit our site now , for your rate quote . click here now ! now that i have had both services , and having noticed that a google search yields no definitive answers for people , i wanted to post my personal review of the two systems . i have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit , both with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via an ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca adapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and sirius for a few months in the pacific northwest . the bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in sound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel quality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more channels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) . after careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have said . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and are streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its oft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm has an extra comedy channel ( it ' s boring , and features older , censored comedy ) , and a few more ' experimental ' music channels which most will find totally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular ( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it ' s no wonder xm doesn ' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you buy . also , xm ' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion . the greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are the staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the corporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying in an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that makes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you ' ve had it up loud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) . this , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my cancelling xm . xm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent music and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept xm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no matter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered everything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the talk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the useful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan . xm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius also has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) . however , xm doesn ' t have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all have to pay xm $ 6 . 99 extra in additon to buying another $ 200 receiver for the house . in addition to the crappy commercials , this is probably where the corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows ."

' i waited patiently . i knew boys like to play . they ' d come to me in their own time . on day two , the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap . the youngest , ben , took a little longer , but yesterday he raced me across the yard thirty times and won every time . the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood . we had such imaginations . in our minds , a tree was a tower to spot approaching bad guys , a big rock became a mountain , a fallen log a space ship headed to the stars . we had toys , but we had to use our imagination , not like the new toys i see my grandkids with . our toys didn ' t talk , and if they did , you pulled a string to make it work . we had blocks to build , crayons to create , trucks and cars to push . they were simple toys that required imagination . i thought about the toys in my garage , the ones i saved , when my children outgrew them . they were simple and needed their imagination to work . mr . potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been . i still have an old plastic phone . it has a dial to turn , a bell that rings when you push a button , and that ' s it . it doesn ' t talk , squawk , beep or move around the room . it ' s simple and was used when they played house , nurse , doctor , and secretary . i have a toy doctor ' s bag , with all the plastic doctor ' s tools . i remember all the broken bones , cuts , bangs , scratches and aches my daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning . most toys today do it all . we don ' t need imagination - - it comes in a box . video games that take us into another world or reality , talking toys , with vocabularies better than most people , computerized toys to teach the alphabet . kids sit and have imagination brought to them . the teaching toys are great , but children tire of them - - it ' s like being in school . when my son was young and tired of his toys , he would come to me and say , ' dad , i ' m bored . ' ' go find something to do , ' i ' d reply . ' i don ' t know what to do . ' ' go outside and find a friend . ' ' naaa ! i don ' t want to do that . ' ' use your imagination . ' ' huh ? ' he asked .

' you know the routine . sports is the same . we ' re entertained for hours watching someone else have fun doing what they ' re good at . wouldn ' t it be better to be playing yourself ? if we don ' t like the sports available to watch , we create new ones . it doesn ' t matter what , people will pay to see it , because they need to be entertained . i haven ' t heard of world championship worm digging , but if someone offered a large cash price , people would buy tickets to scream at the contestants . i worry . are we becoming a society that needs outside influence to have fun ?

"Subject: [ILUG] Create a PAYCHECK with your COMPUTER and Enjoy Cheap ISP & shopping Discount. Hi - ( http://club.4tfox.com ) You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money. Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money. And they expect you to listen to them? Enough. If you want to make money with your computer, then you should hook up with a group that is actually DOING it. We are making a large, continuing income every month. What's more - we will show YOU how to do the same thing. This business is done completely by internet and email, and you can even join for free to check it out first. If you can send an email, you can do this. No special 'skills' are required. How much are we making? Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month. We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time. But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work, and rake in the cash. That kind of job does not exist. But if you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be just the thing you are looking for. This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is done FOR you - it is all based on your effort. But, as I said, there are no special skills required. And this income is RESIDUAL - meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase each month also). Interested? I invite you to find out more. You can get in as a free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you decide it is not for you. We are just looking for people who still have that 'burning desire' to find an opportunity that will reward them incredibly well, if they work at it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind. Looking forward to hearing from you! Sincerely, Hugh Zou P.S.
